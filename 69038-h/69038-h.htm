THE JADE: I</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> would have happened differently for
Bellair had he been drowsy as usual
on this particular Sunday afternoon.
The boarding-house was preparing for
its nap; indeed already half enveloped, but there
came to Bellair’s nostrils a smell of carpets that
brought back his first passage up stairs five years
before. The halls were filled with greys&mdash;dull
tones that drove him forth at last. It was November,
and the day didn’t know what to do
next. Gusts of seasonable wind, wisps of sunshine,
threats of rain, and everywhere Bellair’s
old enemy&mdash;the terrifying Sabbath calm, without
which the naked granite soul of New York
would remain decently hid. Sundays had tortured
him from the beginning. It was not so
bad when the garment was on&mdash;the weave of
millions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>He walked east with an umbrella, thinking
more than observing, crossed to Brooklyn and
followed the water-front as closely as the complication
of ferries, pier-systems and general shipping
would permit. Finally he came to a wooden
arch, marked Hatmos &amp; Company, the gate of
which was open. Entering, he heard the water
slapping the piles beneath, his eyes held in fascination
to an activity ahead. In the wonder of
a dream, he realised that this was a sailing-ship
putting forth. On her black stern, he read</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><i>Jade of Adelaide</i></p>

<p class="no-indent">printed in blue of worn pigment.</p>

<p>A barkentine, her clipper-built hull of steel,
her lines satisfying like the return of a friend
after years. Along the water-line shone the bright
edge of her copper sheathing; then a soft black
line smooth as modelled clay where she muscled
out for sea-worth, and covered her displacement
in the daring beauty of contour. Still above was
the shining brass of her row of ports on a ground
of weathered grey, and the dull red of her rail.
Over all, and that which quickened the ardour of
Bellair’s soul, was the mystery of her wire rigging
and folded cloths against the smoky horizon,
exquisite as the frame of a butterfly to his fancy.</p>

<p>His emotion is not to be explained; nor another
high moment of his life which had to do with a
flashing merchantman seen from the water-front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>at San Francisco&mdash;square-rigged throughout, a
cloud of sail-cloth, her royals yet to be lifted, as
she got underweigh. He knew that considerable
canvas was still spread between California,
Australia and the Islands, but what a well-kept
if ancient maiden of the <i>Jade’s</i> species was doing
here in New York harbour, A. D. Nineteen hundred
and odd, was not disclosed to Bellair until
afterward, and not clearly then.</p>

<p>He knew her for a barkentine, and in the intensely
personal appeal of the moment he was a
bit sorry for the blend. To his eyes the schooner-rig
of mizzen and main masts was not to be
compared for beauty to the trisected fore. Still
he reflected that square-rigged throughout, she
would be crowded with crew to care for her, and
that her concession to trade was at least not outright.
Schooner, bark and brig&mdash;he seemed to
know them first hand, not only from pictures and
pages of print, though there had been many long
evenings of half-dream with books before him&mdash;books
that always pushed back impatiently
through the years of upstart Steam into Nature’s
own navigation, where Romance has put on her
brave true form in the long perspective. Ships
that really <i>sailed</i> were one of Bellair’s passions,
like orchards and vined stone-work&mdash;all far from
him apparently and out of the question&mdash;loved
the more because of it.... He watched with
rapt eyes now, estimated the <i>Jade’s</i> length at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>one-seventy-five and was debating her tonnage
when a huge ox of a man appeared from the
cabin (while the <i>Jade</i> slid farther out), waddled
aft as if bare-footed, spoke to an officer
there, and then held up two brown hairy, thick-fingered
hands, palms extended to the pier&mdash;as if
to push Brooklyn from him forever.... The
officer’s voice just reached shore, but not his
words. A Japanese woman appeared on the
receding deck.</p>

<p>“<i>Jade of Adelaide</i>,” muttered Bellair, moments
afterward.</p>

<p>A tug was towing her straight toward Staten.
He thought of her lying off the glistening white
beach of a coral island two months hence, surrounded
by native craft, all hands helping the
big man get ashore.... At this moment a young
man emerged from the harbour-front door of the
Hatmos office, locking it after him. Bellair came
up from his dream. Such realities of the city man
are mainly secret. It was the worn surface that
Bellair presented to the stranger, a sophisticated
and imperturbable surface, and one employed so
often that its novelty was gone.</p>

<p>“Where’s she going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>Bellair smiled at the facetiousness.</p>

<p>“The <i>Jade</i>,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Just as far from here as she can get.”</p>

<p>“Round the world?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“I doubt if she’ll come back.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see many of them any more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the other agreeably enough, “this
old dame and two or three sisters are about all
that call here. Hatmos &amp; Co. get ’em all.”</p>

<p>“Will you have a little drink?” Bellair inquired.
“That is, if you know a place around
here. I’m from across.”</p>

<p>The other was not unwilling. They walked
up the pier together. A place was found.</p>

<p>“Does the <i>Jade</i> belong to the Hatmos people?”
Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“No. We’re agents for Stackhouse. By the
way, he’s aboard the <i>Jade</i>&mdash;just left the office a
half hour ago. The Hatmos son and heir went
home in a cab, like his father used to, when
Stackhouse blew in from the South Seas&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The big man who stood aft as the ship
cleared?” Bellair suggested.</p>

<p>“Hairy neck&mdash;clothes look like pajamas?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That must have been Stackhouse. He’s the
biggest man in Peloponasia&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair wondered if he meant Polynesia. “You
mean in size?”</p>

<p>“Possibly that, but I meant&mdash;interests. Owns
whole islands and steam-fleets, but hates steam.
Does his pleasure riding under canvas. Comes
up to New York every third year with a new
Japanese wife. Used to spend his time drinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>with old Hatmos&mdash;now he’s trying to kill off
the younger generation. Lives at the <i>Florimel</i>
while in New York, and teaches the dago barboys
how to make tropical drinks. If he had
stayed longer, he would have got to me. Young
Hatmos is about finished.”</p>

<p>Bellair breathed deeply, strangely alive.
“Where does the <i>Jade</i> call first after leaving
here?”</p>

<p>“Savannah&mdash;then one or two South American
ports&mdash;then around the Horn and the long up-beat
to the Islands.”</p>

<p>“Why, that might mean four months.” Bellair
spoke with a touch of wistfulness.</p>

<p>They emerged to the street at length, and the
New Yorker started shyly back to the pier. The
Hatmos man laughed.</p>

<p>“You fall for the sailing-stuff, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s got me. Do they take passengers?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if you’re in no hurry. Here and there,
some one like you&mdash;just for the voyage. Two
or three on board from here.... One a preacher.
He’d better look out. Stackhouse hates to drink
alone.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The <i>Jade</i>, far and very little among the liners,
had turned south to the Narrows and was spreading
her wings.... The world began to shut
Bellair in, as he crossed the river again. Sunday
night supper at the boarding-house was always a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>dismal affair; by every manner and means it was
so to-night. The chorus woman of the Hippodrome
was bolting ahead of the bell, to hurry
away to rehearsal. Nightly she came up out
of the water.... He tried three sea-books that
night&mdash;“Lady Letty,” “Lord Jim” and “The
Phantom,” but couldn’t get caught in their old
spell. A new and personal dimension was upon
him from the afternoon. He fell to dreaming
again and again of the <i>Jade</i>&mdash;the last misty
glimpse of her at the Narrows, and the huge
brown hands pushing Brooklyn away....
There is pathos in the city man’s love and need
for fresh air. Bellair pulled his bed to the window
at last, surveying the room without regard.
Long afterward he dreamed that he was out on
the heaving floor of the sea, and that a man-monster
came down from the deck in pajamas, and
pressing his hands against the walls of the cabin,
made respiration next to impossible for the inmate.
There was a key to this suffocation, for
the air in his room was still as a pool. A lull
had fallen upon the city before a gusty storm of
wind and rain.</p>

LOT &amp; COMPANY: I</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ellair</span> regarded himself as an average
man; and after all perhaps this was the
most significant thing about him. He
was not average to look at&mdash;the face
of a student and profoundly kind&mdash;and yet, he
had moved in binding routine for five years
that they knew of at Lot &amp; Company’s. His
acquaintances were of the average type. He did
not criticise them; you would not have known that
he saw them with something of the same sorrow
that he regarded himself.</p>

<p>Back of this five years was an Unknowable.
Had you possessed exactly the perception you
might have caught a glimpse of some extraordinary
culture that comes from life in the older lands, and
personal contacts with deeper evils&mdash;the culture
of the great drifters, the inimitable polish of rolling
stones. As a usual thing he would not have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>shown you any of this. At Lot &amp; Company’s
offices, men had moved and talked and lunched
near and with him for years without uncovering
a gleam of a certain superb equipment for life
which really existed in a darkened room of his
being.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was still in preparation. We have
not really completed the circle of any accomplishment
until we have put it in action. Certainly
Bellair had not done that, since the Unknowable
ended. He had made no great friends among men
or women; though almost thirty, he had met no
stirring love affair, at least in this period. He
had done the most common duties of trade, for
a common reward in cash; lived in a common
house&mdash;moved in crowds of common men and
affairs. It was as if he were a spy, trained from
a child, but commanded at the very beginning
of his manhood, not only to toil and serve in
an insignificant post&mdash;but to be insignificant as
well. It was by accident, for instance, that they
discovered at Lot &amp; Company’s that Bellair was
schooled in the Sanscrit.</p>

<p>Before usual he was astir that Monday morning,
but late at the office for all that. A drop
of consciousness somewhere between shoe-buttons,
and a similar trance between collar and tie. In
these lapses a half hour was lost, and queerly
enough afterward the old purports of his life
did not hold together as before. A new breath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>from somewhere, a difference in vitality, and the
hum-drum, worn-sore consciousness given to his
work with Lot &amp; Company, had become like an
obscene relative, to be rid of, even at the price
of dollars and the established order of things.
It had been very clear as he drank his coffee that
he must give quit-notice at the office, yet when
he reached there, this was not so easy, and he
was presently at work as usual in his cage with
Mr. Sproxley, the cashier.</p>

<p>The Quaker firm of Lot &amp; Company was essentially
a printing establishment. During the first
half of the period in which Bellair had been connected,
though he was not stupider than usual, he
had not realised the crooked weave of the entire
inner fabric of the house. Lot &amp; Company had
been established for seventy-five years and through
three generations. Its conduct was ordered now
like a process of nature, a systematised tone to
each surface manner and expression. All the departments
were strained and deformed to meet
and adjust in the larger current of profit which the
cashier had somehow bridged without scandal for
twenty-seven years. Personally, so far as Bellair
knew, Mr. Sproxley was an honest man, though
not exactly of the manner, and underpaid.</p>

<p>The cashier’s eyes were black, a black that
would burn you, and unquestionably furtive, although
Bellair sat for two years at a little distance
from the cashier’s desk before he accepted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>the furtiveness, so deeply laid and set and hardened
were his first impressions. They were
hard eyes as well, like that anthracite which
retains its gleaming black edge, though the side to
the draft is red to the core.</p>

<p>Mr. Sproxley’s home was in Brooklyn, an
hour’s ride from the office&mdash;a little flat in a street
of little flats, all with the same porches, brickwork
and rusty numerals. An apartment for two,
and yet Mr. and Mrs. Sproxley had not moved,
though five black-eyed children had come to them.
The cashier of Lot &amp; Company was a stationary
man&mdash;that was his first asset.... A hundred
times Bellair had heard the old formula, delivered
by firm members to some caller at the office:</p>

<p>“This is our cashier, Mr. Sproxley. He has
been with us twenty-seven years. We have found
him the soul of honour”&mdash;the last trailing off into
a whisper&mdash;a hundred times in almost the same
words, for the Lots and the Wetherbees bred true.
The visitor would be drawn off and confidently
informed that Mr. Sproxley would die rather than
leave a penny unaccounted; indeed, that his zeal
on the small as well as large affairs was frequently
a disturbance to the office generally, since everything
stopped until the balance swung free. Bellair
knew of this confidential supplement to the
main form, because he had taken it into his own
pores on an early day of his employment. The
lift of that first talk (in Bellair’s case it was from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>the elder Wetherbee, an occasional Thee and
Thou escaping with unworldly felicity) was for
Bellair sometime to attain a similar rock-bound
austerity of honour.... Always the stranger
glanced a second time at Mr. Sproxley during the
firm-member’s low-voiced affirmation of his passionate
integrity.</p>

<p>Passing to the second floor, the visitor would
meet Mr. Hardburg, head of the manuscript and
periodical department, for Lot &amp; Company had
found a good business in publishing books of story
and poetry at the author’s expense. Here eye
and judgment reigned, Mr. Hardburg’s, on all
matters of book-dress and criticism; yet within
six or seven minutes, the formula would break
through for the attention of the caller, thus:</p>

<p>“Lot &amp; Company is a conservative House&mdash;that’s
why it stands&mdash;a House, sir (one felt the
Capital), that has stood for seventy-five years
on a basis of honour and fair dealing, if on a conservative
basis. Lot &amp; Company stands by its
agents and employés first and last. Lot &amp; Company
does not plunge, but over any given period
of time, its progress is apparent and its policy
significantly successful.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardburg’s eyes kindled as he spoke&mdash;grey
tired eyes, not at all like Mr. Sproxley’s&mdash;but the
light waned, and Mr. Hardburg quickly relapsed
into ennui and complaint, for he was a living
sick man. The impression one drew from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>earlier years, was that he had overstrained as an
athlete, and been a bit loose and undone ever
since.... Now Mr. Hardburg would be called
away for a moment, leaving the stranger in the
office with Miss Rinderley, his assistant. With
fluent and well directed sentences, this lady would
outline the triumphs of Mr. Hardburg from college
to the mastery of criticism which he was now
granted professionally.</p>

<p>“But what we love best about him,” Miss
Rinderley would say, glancing at the enlarged
photograph above his desk, “is the tireless way
he helps young men. Always he is at that. I
have seen him talk here for an hour&mdash;when the
most pressing matters of criticism and editorial
responsibility called&mdash;literally giving himself to
some one needing help. Very likely he would
miss his train for the country. Poor Mr. Hardburg,
he needs his rest so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The caller would cry in his heart, “What a
superb old institution this is!” and cover his own
weaknesses and shortcomings in a further sheath
of mannerism and appreciation&mdash;the entire atmosphere
strangely prevailing to help one to stifle
rather than to ventilate his real points of view.</p>

<p>So the establishment moved. The groups of
girls going up and down the back stairs&mdash;to count
or tie or paste through all their interesting days&mdash;counted
the heads of their respective departments
as their greatest men; spoke of them in awed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>whispers, in certain cases with maternal affection,
and on occasion even with playful intimacy on
the part of a few&mdash;but always as a master-workman,
the best man in the business, who expressed
the poorest part of himself in words, and
had to be lived with for years adequately to be
appreciated and understood.</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan Lot, the present head of the firm,
was a dreamer. It was Mr. Sproxley who had
first told Bellair this, but he heard it frequently
afterward, came to recognise it as the accepted
initial saying as regarded the Head, just as his
impeccable honour was Mr. Sproxley’s and unerring
critical instinct Mr. Hardburg’s titular
association. Mr. Nathan was the least quarrelsome
man anywhere, the quietest and the gentlest&mdash;a
small bloodless man of fifty, aloof from business;
a man who had worn and tested himself so
little that you would imagine him destined to live
as long again, except for the lugubrious atmospheres
around his desk, in the morning especially,
the sense of imperfect ventilation, though the partitions
were but half-high to the lower floor and
there was a thousand feet to draw from. The
same was beginning in Jabez, the son, something
pent, non-assimilation somewhere. However
Jabez wasn’t a dreamer; at least, dreaming had
not become his identifying proclivity. He was
a head taller than his father with a wide limp
mouth and small expressionless brown eyes&mdash;twenty-seven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and almost as many times a millionaire.</p>

<p>Jabez was richer than his father, who was the
direct heir of the House of Lot, but his father’s
dreaming had complicated the flow of another
huge fortune in the familiar domestic fashion&mdash;Jabez
being the symbol and centre of the combination;
also the future head of the House of
Lot and Company&mdash;up and down town.</p>

<p>Bellair wondered a long time what the pervading
dream of the father was. He had been
in the office many months, had never heard the
senior-mind give vent to authoritative saying in
finance, literature, science or prints; and while this
did not lower his estimate at all&mdash;he was sincerely
eager to get at the sleeping force of this
giant. Mr. Sproxley spoke long on the subject,
but did not know. Mr. Hardburg said:</p>

<p>“I have been associated with Mr. Nathan for
eleven years now. The appeal of his worth is
not eager and insinuating, but I have this to say&mdash;that
in eleven years I have found myself slipping,
slipping into a mysterious, <i>a different</i> regard,
a profounder friendliness&mdash;if one might put
it that way&mdash;for Mr. Nathan, than any I have
known in my whole career. The fact is I love
Mr. Nathan. He is one of the sweetest spirits
I ever knew.”</p>

<p>Bellair was interested in dreamers; had a theory
that dreaming was important. When he heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>that a certain child was inclined to dreaming, he
was apt to promise a significant future off-hand.
He reflected that even Mr. Hardburg had forgotten
to tell him of the tendency in Mr. Nathan’s
case, but determined not to give up.... Once
in the lower part of the city, he passed the firm-head&mdash;a
studious little man making his way along
at the edge of the walk. Bellair spoke before he
thought. Mr. Nathan started up in a dazed way,
appeared to recognise him with difficulty, as if
there was something in the face that the hat made
different. He cleared his voice and inquired with
embarrassment:</p>

<p>“Are you going to the store?”</p>

<p>After Bellair had ceased to regret speaking, he
reflected upon the word “store.” The president
of a great manufacturing plant, content to be
known as a tradesman&mdash;an excellent, a Quaker
simplicity about that.</p>

<p>Bellair’s particular friend in the establishment
was Broadwell of the advertising-desk, a young
man of his own age who was improving himself
evenings and who aspired to be a publisher. But
even closer to his heart was Davy Acton, one of
the office-boys, who had been tested out and was
not a liar. A sincere sad-faced lad of fifteen, who
lived with his mother somewhere away down
town. He looked up to Bellair as to a man among
men, one who had achieved. This was hard to
bear on the man’s part, but he was fond of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>youngster and often had him over Sundays, furnishing
books of his own and recommending
others. Davy believed in him. This was the
sensation.</p>

<p>The only voices that were ever raised in the
establishment were those of the travelling salesmen.
The chief of this department, Mr. Rawter,
was loud-voiced in his joviality. That was <i>his</i>
word&mdash;“Mr. Rawter is so jovial.”</p>

<p>When the roaring joviality of Mr. Rawter
boomed through the lower floor, old Mr. Wetherbee,
the vice-president, would look up from his
desk, and remark quietly to any one who happened
near, “Mr. Rawter is forced to meet the trade,
you know.” It was doubtless his gentle Quaker
conception that wine-lists, back-slapping and
whole-souled abandonment of to-morrow, were
essentials of the road and trade affiliation. From
the rear of the main floor, back among the piles
of stock, reverberating among great square monuments
of ledgers and pamphlets were the jovial
voices of the other salesmen, Mr. Rawter’s seconds,
the Middle-west man, and the Coast-and-South
man&mdash;voices slightly muffled, as became
their station, but regular in joviality, and doubtless
as boom-compelling afield as their chief’s,
considering their years.</p>

<p>Otherwise the elder Mr. Wetherbee&mdash;Mr. Seth&mdash;presided
over a distinguished silence for the
main. His desk was open to the floor at large.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>He was seventy, and one of the first to arrive in
the morning&mdash;a vice-president who opened the
mail, and had in expert scrutiny such matters as
employment, salaries, orders and expenses of the
travelling men on the road. Mr. Seth was not a
dreamer; at least not on week-days&mdash;a millionaire,
who gave you the impression that he was
constantly on his guard lest his heart-quality
should suddenly ruin all. The love, the very
ardour of his soul was to <i>give</i> away&mdash;to dissipate
the fortunes of his own and the firm-members, but
so successfully had he fought all his life on the
basis of considering the justice to his family and
his firm, that Lot &amp; Company now relied upon
him, undoubting. Thus often a man born
with weakness develops it into his particular
strength....</p>

<p>The son, Eben Wetherbee, was harder for Bellair
to designate. He seemed a different force,
and called forth secret regard. A religious young
man, who always occurred to Bellair’s mind as he
had once seen him, crossing the Square a summer
evening, a book under his arm, his short steps
lifted and queerly rounded, as if treading a low-geared
sprocket; toes straight out&mdash;the whole gait
mincing a little. Eben was smileless and a great
worker. He had no more to do or say with his
father during working hours than any of the
others.</p>

<p>Such was the firm: Mr. Nathan Lot and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>son Jabez; Mr. Seth Wetherbee and his son Eben,
and Mr. Rawter who had been given a nominal
quantity of stock after thirty-five years’ service.
In due course Mr. Sproxley would qualify for
this illumination.... And yet not all. Staring
down from the arch over the president’s door
was a dour, white, big-chinned face, done in oils
long ago&mdash;almost yellow-white, the black shoulder
deadening away into the background; small
eyes, wide mouth, but firmly hung&mdash;grandfather
to Mr. Nathan, but no dreamer; great grand-sire
to Mr. Jabez, but nothing loose-mouthed about
the face of this, the original Jabez Lot,&mdash;organising
genius of the House, and its first president,
spoken of with awe and reverence; the first millionaire
of the family and builder of its Gramercy
mansion.... Suddenly, it had come to Bellair
that this was the spirit of the Store, this picture
was its symbol, that the slow strangulation
of the souls of all concerned had begun in that
white head, the planting of this bed of crooked
canes.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">One morning when Bellair was well into his third
year with the printing-firm, the silence was broken
on the lower floor. He was shaken that day into
the real secret of the house. A certain Mr.
Prentidd had been in conversation with Mr.
Rawter some moments. The jovial voice of
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>the head-salesman was without significance to
those near his partition&mdash;a part of the routine.
Mr. Prentidd had invented a combination
ledger and voucher-file that was having some
sale in America, being manufactured and distributed
by Lot &amp; Company. Mr. Rawter on a
recent trip abroad had been empowered to dispose
of the English rights. The result, it now
appeared, did not prove satisfactory to the inventor.
The voice of the latter was raised. One
felt the entire building subside into a quivering
hush.</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir, I don’t trust you. I have heard
in fact that the only way you could hurt your
reputation here in New York or on the road would
be to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>To Bellair there was something deeply satisfying
in that remark of the inventor’s&mdash;something
long awaited and very good. He saw Mr. Seth
arise, his chin moving in a sickly fashion, a very
old pathetic Mr. Seth. He realised that Mr.
Rawter had laughed&mdash;that something had been
burned from that laugh. Mr. Prentidd was hurried
forth, and the nullifying system began. Mr.
Jabez emerged from his father’s office and turning
to Broadwell at the advertising-desk, said in
a tone universally penetrative:</p>

<p>“What a pity that Mr. Prentidd drinks. There
are few men finer to deal with when he is
himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Seth, in his chair again, sitting frog-like
and gasping, remarked to Mr. Sproxley across the
distance: “I really must ask Mr. Prentidd to
come to us earlier in the day. He’s far too worthy
a man to disgrace himself in this way.”</p>

<p>Bellair wondered that the point of Mr. Prentidd’s
remark seemed entirely lost. As for himself
he counted it worthy of regard. The episode
was but begun. The inventor returned immediately,
just as Mr. Rawter was stepping out.
The two men met in the main corridor. It appeared
that Mr. Prentidd repeated a certain question,
for the head-salesman replied, the roundness
of the joviality gone from his voice:</p>

<p>“I tell you, Mr. Prentidd, the situation has
changed. I could not dispose of the English order
at a better figure to save my soul. I extracted
every cent for you and for the House.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you. Other matters of the
same kind do better. If you speak the truth, you
made a very bad bargain for yourself and what is
more important, for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The least like an inventor imaginable, a most
physical person, Mr. Prentidd, with a fiery sense
of his own rights and a manner as soft as his voice
was penetrating. He turned a leisurely look of
scorn at Mr. Rawter, half-stare and half-smile,
then appeared to perceive the elder Mr. Wetherbee
for the first time. The old man arose. Bellair
felt the agony of expectancy far back among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>the stock-piles. The inventor shot straight at
the vice-president:</p>

<p>“You’re an old man. I’ll trust your word.
You’re an old man and a Quaker&mdash;yes, I’ll take
your word. Your man, Rawter, says he could
get only seven and one-half cents’ royalty for me
on my Nubian file from England. I say it’s only
half what I should get. Is it true&mdash;remember
you’re old. Is it true?”</p>

<p>Prentidd’s face had power in it, exasperation
and the remains of a laugh. It appeared that he
was content to take a gambler’s chance and close
the ugly business on Mr. Seth’s word.</p>

<p>The old man’s eye roved. He looked sick and
shaken. He found the eyes of his son Eben which
were full of terror and pity and hope.</p>

<p>“Answer me. Could Lot &amp; Company get no
more than fifteen cents altogether on the English
patents?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wetherbee’s lips moved. “That’s all
we could get, Mr. Prentidd. I’m sorry,” he
said.</p>

<p>For an instant Mr. Prentidd stood there. It
was evident that he had expected a different
answer. True to his promise to take the old man’s
word, however, he turned on his heel and walked
out.</p>

<p>On the high sloping desk before Bellair’s eyes,
a big ledger lay open. He had turned during the
talk to the transaction of Prentidd&mdash;Lot &amp; Company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
The English disposal had been arranged for
at twenty-five cents the file, royalty. Apparently
Mr. Prentidd had agreed upon an even split, but
Lot &amp; Company had taken seventeen and the
fraction.</p>

<p>Bellair was ill. The nausea crept down through
his limbs, and up to his throat. The thing had
worked out before him with such surety and
clarity. The head of Mr. Sproxley moved about
as if on a swivel, his body in writing position
still. Presently he stepped down from his high
stool, and came to Bellair’s side. Placing his pen
behind his ear, he lifted the ledger from under
Bellair’s eyes, his lips compressed with the effort.
Then he placed it on his own desk to close it
tenderly, after which it was taken to its niche
in the vault.</p>

<p>The office was silent. Just now Bellair’s eyes
turned as if subtly attracted to the place where
Eben Wetherbee sat. The young man’s smileless
eyes, almost insane with apprehension and
sadness, were turned with extraordinary intent
upon the place where his father sat. Bellair’s
followed. The old man sat plumped in his chair;
he gulped, tried to turn. His face looked as if
he heard a ghost whispering. Yet he seemed unable
to trust himself, hardly daring to meet the
eyes that awaited. His hands lifted to the papers
before him, but did not feel properly. He seemed
a man of eighty. Mr. Eben came forward at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>last and asked Mr. Sproxley if he might look at
the Prentidd transaction.</p>

<p>“It isn’t posted yet, Mr. Eben,” said the
cashier.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the side door at closing time, Bellair happened
to pass a party of young women coming
down from the bindery. One was saying:</p>

<p>“... and Mr. Prentidd was quite helpless
after the scene&mdash;so that they had to call a taxi-cab
for him. Isn’t it dreadful he drinks so?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a personal result for Bellair, which
he at no time misunderstood.</p>

<p>“We have considered creating a position for
you next to Mr. Sproxley,” said the elder Mr.
Wetherbee, the second morning following.</p>

<p>Bellair bowed.</p>

<p>“Since you have been with us less than three
years, this is very good comment on the character
of your services and our hope for your future
with us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What additional salary goes with the position?”
Bellair had asked.</p>

<p>“If I followed my own inclination, it would
be considerable. I have been able to secure for
you, however, but a slight increase&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>This was one of Mr. Seth’s little ways. He
added hopes of fine quality. There was a further
point:</p>

<p>“You will at times handle considerable money
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>and we must insist upon your putting in trust for
us the sum of two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t two thousand dollars, Mr. Wetherbee,”
Bellair said.</p>

<p>“Of course, we trust you. It is a form&mdash;a
form, nevertheless, upon which a valuable relation
of this kind should be placed on a business
basis.”</p>

<p>Bellair repeated.</p>

<p>“But you have friends&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not with two thousand dollars’ surety for me&mdash;no
friend like that.”</p>

<p>“Banks insist upon this&mdash;among those employés
who handle much money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;but that amount cannot be arranged.”</p>

<p>“How much can you put in trust available
to Lot &amp; Company in event of your departure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have slightly less than one thousand
dollars&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Could you raise one thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“With some effort.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it will draw interest for you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand these affairs.”</p>

<p>The matter was referred to the next day when
it was decided to accept Bellair’s amount of one
thousand dollars, which Lot &amp; Company could
not touch without his consent, except in the event
of his departure with company funds; and which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>Bellair could not draw without written statement
from Lot &amp; Company to the effect that he
was leaving with a balanced account.</p>

<p>Thereafter he was one with Mr. Sproxley in
the financial management, under the eye of Seth
Wetherbee. One by one he learned the points of
the system. Wherever the accounts had run over
a series of years, there were byways of loot. These
pilferings were not made at once, on the same
basis that a gardener does not cut asparagus for
market from young roots. The plants were encouraged
to establish themselves. After that
the open market was supplied with a certain output,
the rest belonging to Lot &amp; Company’s table.
It frequently occurred to Bellair with a sort of
enveloping darkness that he had the institution
in his power; and with a different but equal force
that he had a life position in all naturalness; that
his life would be spent with slowly increasing
monetary reward for juggling the different accounts&mdash;the
field of crooked canes which was the
asparagus-bed of Lot &amp; Company. He did not
like it. He was not happy; and yet he realised
that the adjustments his nature had already made
to the facts, suggested an entire adjustment later,
the final easy acceptance.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair had thought many times of getting
out from under the die, but it never came to
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>him with quite the force as on that Monday
morning, after watching the <i>Jade</i> fare forth from
the Brooklyn water-front. Something had turned
within him as a result of that little pilgrimage,
something that spurred to radicalism and self-assertion.
At no time had Bellair credited himself
with a fairer honesty than most men. He
had never given it a large part of thinking.
Roughly he had believed that to be honest is the
common lot. The corruption in the office which
he could not assimilate had to do with extensive
ramifications, its lying to itself. The instant seizing
upon Mr. Prentidd’s alleged weakness on the
part of the younger Lot and the elder Wetherbee;
the action of Mr. Sproxley with the ledger; the
subtle will-breaking and spiritual blinding of all
the employés in a process that never slept and
was operative in every thought and pulse of the
establishment&mdash;the extent and talent of these,
and the untellable blackness of it all, prevailed
upon Bellair with the force of a life-impression.</p>

<p>Bellair’s present devil was a kind of inertia.
Granting that the Unknowable had been charged
with periods of intense action of several kinds,
the recent half-decade might be regarded as its
reflex condition. There is an ebb and flow to all
things, and it is easier to adjust Bellair’s years
at Lot &amp; Company as a sort of resting period
for his faculties, than to accept a constitutional
inertia in his case, for subsequent events do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>quite bear that out. He doubtless belonged to
that small class of down town men who do their
work well enough, but without passion, who have
faced the modern world and its need of bread and
cake, and who have compromised, giving hours in
exchange for essential commodities, but nothing
like the full energies of their lives. It is a way
beset with pitfalls, but the unavoidable result of
a system that multiplies products and profits and
minimizes the chances for fine workmanship on
every hand. Moreover in Bellair’s case there is a
philosophical detachment to be considered. The
aims and purports of the printing establishment
were coldly and absolutely material. These did
not challenge him to any fine or full expenditure
of his powers; and if he had touched that higher
zone of philosophy which makes a consecration of
the simplest and the heaviest tasks, he had at least
found it impracticable to make it work among the
systems of Lot &amp; Company’s business.</p>

<p>The two years or more since he was made assistant
cashier had brought many further items and
exhibits. He was now used on the left hand side
of the throne, developed in the darkness-department
already overworked, the eye of which was
Mr. Seth and the hand, Mr. Sproxley. For as
yet Bellair believed that even Eben Wetherbee
had only suspicions. This was the bite of the
whole drama. There were men in the building
who would have died for their conviction that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>House was honest. You might have told these
men that Lot &amp; Company was a morgue of conservatism;
that having existed under a certain
policy for seventy-five years, was the chief reason
for its changing; that free, unhampered genius
never found utterance through that House&mdash;and
any of a dozen clerks would have laughed, spoken
proudly of unerring dividends and uncanny stability,
granting the rest. But that Lot &amp; Company
was structurally crooked was incredible except to
the few who performed the trick. Bellair knew,
for instance, that his best friend in the office,
Broadwell, head of the advertising, was innocent....</p>

<p>Monday passed without his giving notice. He
quailed before the questions that would be asked.
If it were not for the one thousand dollars, he
would have escaped with a mere “Good-night,”
though a panic would have started until the Company
was assured of the innocence of his departure.
As for a panic, Lot &amp; Company had that
coming, he thought. Now he knew that he would
not be able to get his surety-deposit until all was
made certain in his regard by the firm....</p>

<p>Bellair wasn’t greedy, nor caught in any great
desire for wealth. He had fallen into the Down town
Stream, but did not belong. Every month
had weakened him. He disliked to lose his beginnings
toward competence; all the subtle pressures
of Lot &amp; Company worked upon him not to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>change. There was no other way open. He had
been touched by the fear of fear&mdash;a sort of poorhouse
horror that dogs men up into the millions
and down to the grave. In a way, he had become
slave to the Job. He even had the suspicion that
more men maim their souls by sticking to their
jobs than by any dissipation. This is the way to
the fear of fear&mdash;the insane undertow of modern
materialism.</p>

<p>He had tried to find peace outside his work in
music and different philanthropies, but the people
he met, their seriousness, perhaps more than anything
else, and the vanity of their intellectualism,
aroused his sense of humour. Bellair believed in
the many, but was losing belief in himself. Often
he had turned back to evenings in the room, and
realised that the days were draining him too much
for his own real expression of any kind. Always
he felt that Lot &amp; Company was too strong for
his temper, that his edge was dulled in every contact.
From his depressions, he saw ahead only
two ways&mdash;a life of this, or a moment in which
he had Lot &amp; Company in his power unequivocably.
The last was poisonous, and he knew it.
He would have to fall considerably to profit by
this sort of thing, but the inevitable conclusion
of the whole matter, was that the life with Lot &amp;
Company was slowly but surely <i>getting him down</i>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday noon, Mr. Seth asked him to take
to lunch a certain young stationer from Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
named Filbrick. They were made acquainted
in the corridor. Passing out, Bellair
and his companion met the smile of Mr. Sproxley.
Bellair began the formula of the cashier’s absolute
and autocratic integrity. He did not really
hear himself, until he reached this part:</p>

<p>“I happen to be in the financial department.
Two or three times each year, the whole office is
thrown into a mess over some little strayed account&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped. It was less that he was saying
this, than that he had come so far without a nudge
from within. They had passed the big front
doors, and met the wind of the street before he
realised how deep the mannerism of the establishment
had prevailed upon him. The process had
passed almost into fulfilment before the truth
within him had stirred from its sleep.... A very
grey day. All through that luncheon he had found
himself at angles from his companion, in strategic
hollows, never in the level open. It wasn’t that
he was different from usual, but that he was
watching himself more shrewdly. His inner coherence
was repeatedly broken, though the outer
effects were not. He had never perceived before
with such clarity that a man cannot be square
and friendly to another man, when his mind and
critical faculties are busy appraising him, while
his eyes and lips approved and assuaged. Bellair
that day realised his moral derangement&mdash;that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>must be ripped open and his displaced organs corrected
once for all, if anything decent was to come
from him ever again.... He was still thinking
in mid-afternoon, in the very trance of these
thoughts, when he happened to look into Mr.
Sproxley’s face. It seemed to him that there was
a movement of most pitiful activities back of the
red and black of Mr. Sproxley’s eyes.</p>

<p>There was much mental roving on Bellair’s part
that week; moments in which the Monday morning
abandon returned, and his self-amazement of
the Tuesday luncheon, upon discovering how
deeply his thoughts were imbedded in the prevailing
lie. New York and the salary clutched him
hard at intervals; so that he saw something of
what was meant to give it up; also he saw that
dreams are dreams.... Thousands of other
young men would be glad to do his work, even
his dirty work.</p>

<p>He had just returned from lunch on Friday
when he started, to perceive the ruddy face and
powerful frame of Mr. Prentidd darken the front
door&mdash;which he had not done since his voice was
last raised. Bellair was conscious of Seth Wetherbee
hitching up his chair and a peculiar gasping
cough from the old man, but his own eyes did not
turn from the caller’s face&mdash;which moved slowly
about, the pale little exchange-miss behind the
first barrier, attentive to catch the stranger’s eye
and answer his question. The inventor glanced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>slowly among desks and doors. His eye sought
Sproxley, and the furtive black eyes of the latter
shot down to his ledger as if crippled on the wing.
His eyes held Bellair and the young man felt the
scorn of ages burn through his veins&mdash;something
new to his later life, yet deep in his heart, something
he had known somewhere before, as if he
had betrayed a good king, and his punishment
had been to look that king in the eye before he
died. Bellair had never hated himself as at that
moment, and certainly never before felt himself
identified body and soul with modern corruption,
as now with scorn like a fiery astringent in his
veins. The eyes of Mr. Prentidd finally settled
upon the figure of Mr. Seth Wetherbee, their rays
striking him abeam as it were. The old man
hunched closer if anything, but did not raise his
head.</p>

<p>The inventor was a physical person; his morals
of a physical nature; his Nubian file of the same
dimension and method of mind&mdash;a strong man
who had to do with pain and pleasure of the flesh;
his ideas of possessions were of the world. He
moved softly, a soft, dangerous smile upon his
lips, to the desk of the vice-president and jerked
up a chair. The old man had to raise his head.
It was as if the scene of three years ago was now
to be continued, for Bellair saw the sorrowful,
lengthened face of Mr. Eben turn from his desk in
the other room and bend toward his father, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>face was intensely pathetic now in its forced smile
of greeting.</p>

<p>“You’re not looking well&mdash;in fact, you’re looking
old, Mr. Wetherbee, as if you would die pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so strong as I was, Mr. Prentidd.”</p>

<p>Bellair couldn’t have done it, as the inventor
did. Had the man stolen and ruined him&mdash;he
could not have pushed on after the pathos of that.</p>

<p>“You’re a dirty old man&mdash;and you’ll die hard
and soon&mdash;for you lied to me when I trusted you.
I suppose you have lied to everybody, all your
life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Thus he baited Mr. Seth feature by feature,
pointing out the disorder of liver, kidney-puffs, the
general encroachments of death, in fact. Then he
pictured the death itself&mdash;all of a low literary
strength as was Mr. Prentidd’s cold habit. The
answer of Mr. Seth was an incoherent helplessness,
his lips moving but with nothing rational
under the sun, as if he had been called by some inexorable
but superior being to an altitude where he
was too evil to breathe, and begged piteously to
be allowed to sink back and die. It was Mr.
Eben who stopped it, coming forward quietly, his
steps rounded, his shoulders bent, his face seeming
brittle as chalk in its fixity. The thing that he
said was quite absurd:</p>

<p>“You really mustn’t, Mr. Prentidd. It is too
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>The inventor turned to him. His look was that
of a man who turns a large morsel in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” he said with a slow
laugh. “There is this delicacy to old liars. Come
give me my check&mdash;and I will go.”</p>

<p>“Your check&mdash;&mdash;” Mr. Eben repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, now&mdash;the check for the difference which
your father’s lie cost me three years ago. I have
seen the English books&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Now young Mr. Jabez Lot came forward:</p>

<p>“Of course, if there has been error or any
breach of contract&mdash;of course, you see a check off
hand such as you ask is out of the question&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Wetherbee sank back to his desk;
and now the dreamer, Mr. Nathan Lot, appeared
with a frightened word of amelioration. Mr. Eben
stood by the caller to the last moment. The latter
was not at his best in this period&mdash;his threats and
anger amounted to the usual result. Lot &amp; Company
refused to deal further, referring him to its
attorney. The strangest part of it all was the
gathering of three around Mr. Seth Wetherbee’s
desk&mdash;Mr. Jabez and his father with Mr. Eben.
Yet the concern of the Lots, father and son, had
nothing to do with dangerous exhaustion of the
vice-president.</p>

<p>“We have beaten him,” the dreamer said softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Jackson will do the rest,” said Mr.
Jabez. Mr. Jackson was the attorney.</p>

<p>Bellair, even with his training, had to take it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>slowly. “Beaten him”&mdash;that meant that the
money had not passed to Mr. Prentidd. It was
now with the law and the years&mdash;millions against
a mere inventor. The psychic slaughtering of the
old vice-president did not count&mdash;nothing of
words counted. The firm had won, because the
firm had not been knocked down and its pockets
rifled&mdash;that would have meant loss. Not having
been forced to pay, they had won.... Even as
Bellair thought this out in full, the system of
salving had begun from all the firm-heads for the
benefit of those who heard. It was simply arranged
and stated.... Their worst fears were
realised: Mr. Prentidd was insane.... Mr.
Seth went home early. Bellair knew that Mr.
Eben had not been able to turn all responsibility
to Mr. Jackson.... That afternoon Bellair
reached his decision&mdash;in fact, he found it finished
within him after the scene.</p>

<p>Yet he could not walk out at once, since he
must have the amount of his surety, the item of
interest and salary due. A certain project in his
mind prevented the possibility of waiting several
days for this amount to be detached from Lot &amp;
Company. Especially now after the final scene,
they would make themselves very sure of his accounts
and intentions. Late that Friday afternoon,
it happened that considerable cash came in
after banking hours. Bellair’s custom was to put
this in a safety-vault until the following day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>This time he held out the amount of his deposit
and two years’ interest, together with the amount
of his salary to date, locking up with the balance
his order of release to the account of the Trust
company. He determined to write a letter to
Nathan Lot at once....</p>

<p class="center no-indent">4</p>

<p class="no-indent">The City had a different look to him that night
in his new sense of detachment. There were
moments at dinner in which he felt as if he were
already forgotten and out of place. Bellair had
only known the one landlady in his five years
of New York; yet he knew this one no better
now than at the end of the first month. Perhaps
there was nothing more to learn. She was
anæmic of body, and yet did prodigious tasks,
very quiet, very grey; and days to her were
like endless rooms of the same house, all grim
and uniform. She had her little ways, her continual
suspicions, but all her faith was gone.
Without church, without friends, without any
new thought or gossip, her view of the world was
neither magnified nor diminished, but greatly
shortened, her eyes were almost incredibly dim.
There was nothing to love about her. She was
not excessively clean, nor excellent in cooking.
She was like wax-work, a little dusty, her mind
and all. Bellair paid her for the week, and added
a present:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Which I forgot on your birthday,” he said.</p>

<p>She held it in her hand. It did not seem hers.
The apathy extended to all that was not actually
due; all expectancy dead.</p>

<p>“You mean you are giving this to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Bellair,&mdash;perhaps you will
want it some time again.”</p>

<p>He wrote the letter to Mr. Nathan, but decided
not to mail it until the last thing. He was restless
over the irregularity in the money affair&mdash;had
to assure himself again and again that he
was taking not a cent that did not belong to him.
The boarding-house was in the upper Forties between
Broadway and Sixth avenue, and though
he usually turned eastward for pleasure, this night
he went among his own people, where even a
nickle was medium of exchange. A stimulant did
not exactly relieve his tension. His sense was
that of loneliness, as he chose a table in <i>Brandt’s</i>
indoor garden.</p>

<p>A mixed quartette presently broke into song behind
him. Bellair’s thoughts were far from song.
He was not expectant of music that would satisfy.
Still something tugged him&mdash;again and again&mdash;until
he really listened, but without turning. It
was the voice of the contralto that was making
an impression deep where his need was. There
seemed an endless purple background to it, like a
night of stars and south wind; the soft, deep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>volume rolled forth <i>for him</i>, and found itself expressed
without amazement or travail. He turned
now. The one voice was from the throat of a
girl, just a girl, and though it was a gusty November,
she was still wearing her summer hat.</p>

<p>The face was merely pretty, but the voice was
drama; flame of poppies in the presence of a
fabulous orchid. Bellair’s heart may have been
particularly sensitive to impression that night.
The big brilliant den known as <i>Brandt’s</i> did not
seem to have been cast into any enchantment; and
yet it was likely that Bellair knew as much about
music natively and by acquisition as any one present.
In fact, he had reached the state of appreciation
which dares to enjoy that which appeals and
to say so, having endured for several winters a
zeal which rushed him from one to another
musical event, intolerant of all save classic symphonies.
It wasn’t the music that held him now&mdash;a
high flowery operatic matter not particularly
interesting nor well-done&mdash;but the contralto was
just a little girl, and the round girlish breast which
held nothing miraculous for the many, was sending
forth tones that quivered through Bellair,
spine and thigh, and thrilling his mind with a
profound passion to do something for the singer&mdash;an
intrinsic and clean emotion, but one which
made him ashamed. For an instant, he felt himself
setting out on the great adventure of his life,
the faintest aroma of its romance touching his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>senses; something akin to his dreams in the prison
of Lot &amp; Company, and which he had not sensed
at all since his departure, until this instant.
Quickly it passed; yet he had the sense that
this great romance had to do with the little
singer.</p>

<p>At once he wanted to take her from the other
three; dreamed of working for her, so that she
might have the chance she craved. Of course, she
wanted something terribly; passionate want always
went with such a voice. He saw her future
alone. Some vampire of a manager would hear
her. She would tie up&mdash;the little summer hat
told him that. She would tie up, and New York
would take her bloom before the flower matured&mdash;would
take more than her little song. Here
she was in <i>Brandt’s</i> already, and singing as if for
the angels.</p>

<p>Bellair was four-fifths undiscovered country,
as are all men but the very few, who dare to be
themselves. Already the world was calling to him
sharply for this first step aside from the worn
highways of the crowd. He had not been normal
to-night, even in his room; and his present adventure
had already summoned forth all the hateful
reserves of his training, as Prentidd’s departure
had started the lies through the floors and halls
of Lot &amp; Company. His heart was calling out to
the little singer, that here was a friend, one who
understood and wanted nothing but to give; yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>all that he had learned from the world was beating
him back into the crowd.</p>

<p>He saw that the music had hardly penetrated
the vast vulgar throng. New York is so accustomed
to be amused, to dine to music and forget
itself in various entertainments, that the quartette
barely held its own against the routine of eating
and drink and the voices of rising stimulation.
It was Bellair who started the little applause when
the first number was over. He hated to do it.
The clapping of hands drew to himself eyes that
he did not care to cultivate, but it seemed the only
way just then to help her to make good.</p>

<p>The four of the quartette looked at him curiously,
appraising his value as a critic, perhaps.
Was he drunk or really appealed to? Was he
worth considering? Applause at any price is
dearly to be had. They took him in good faith,
since he was not without desirable appearance.
The young girl and the tenor arose and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Oh, that we two were Maying&mdash;&mdash;</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old song was a kind of fulfilment for
Bellair, and preciously wrung his heart. He had
never been Maying; wasn’t sure what sort of holidays
were pulled off in regular Mayings; but he
liked the song, and for all he knew the familiar
sentiment was evoked bewitchingly. Many others
now caught the thrall. These things are infectious.
From hatred, he came to love <i>Brandt’s</i>&mdash;as
if he had come home, and had been long away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>hungering&mdash;as if this were life, indeed....
They sang the last verse again, and sat down for
hurried refreshment. The four were very near.
The young girl caught Bellair’s eye, regarded him
shyly for an instant, and turned to whisper to
the bass, who seemed in charge of the four.</p>

<p>“... Yes, but hurry back. We’ve got to pull
out of here.”</p>

<p>Bellair wasn’t dangling. Never had he been
more intent to be decent and helpful. No one
knew this. Even the girl was far from expectant.
... She sat down beside him.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said. “You don’t live in New
York, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you looked so homesick&mdash;when we sang.”</p>

<p>Bellair’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“I think I was homesick. What may I order
for you?”</p>

<p>“A little Rhine wine&mdash;it’s very good here&mdash;and
a sandwich&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The waiter was standing by. Bellair had to
clear his voice before ordering. He was distressed&mdash;up
to his eyes in gloom that was general and
without name.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">5</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Do you sing in other places to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’re just beginning. We’re on
Broadway at eleven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“First at <i>Pastern’s</i>, then at the <i>Castle</i>.”</p>

<p>These places were just without the orbit of
extravagance. She knew her answer was not
exactly a stock-raiser, and added:</p>

<p>“But I expect to be on the road in the
Spring&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who with?”</p>

<p>She mentioned a light opera troupe that was
just short of broad and unqualified approval&mdash;like
<i>Brandt’s</i> and <i>Pastern’s</i>&mdash;an institution as yet
without that mysterious toppiness which needs no
props and meets sanction anywhere. These things
are exactly ordered.</p>

<p>“But you are so good&mdash;you should be with people
who would help you.”</p>

<p>She looked at him a little scornfully, something
of weather and stress under the summer hat. She
decided to be agreeable. “They all say that,”
she said wearily.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I said just what I thought.”</p>

<p>“Study&mdash;a girl without a cent!” She lowered
her voice: “Go with better people&mdash;before one is
invited? Swing to the top of the opera before
one is sufficiently urged?... Why, singing isn’t
all. One must do more than sing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You should try. Singing won’t get you
across. You’ve got to act, for one thing.”</p>

<p>He was relieved that she did not discuss the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>angel business, which is forgotten in so few stories
of struggle and failure.</p>

<p>“I tell you, all that one has to do is to sing&mdash;when
one sings as you do.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that many times,” she said bitterly,
“from people not in the fight. They didn’t
come to New York on their nerve&mdash;as I did. I
made up my mind not to be afraid of wolves or
bears or cars&mdash;to take what I could get, and wait
until somebody beckoned me higher. Meanwhile
<i>Pastern’s</i> and the <i>Castle</i> and here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wish I could do something for you.”</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed at him.</p>

<p>“You need money?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I need money so terribly&mdash;that it’s almost a
joke&mdash;but what do <i>you</i> want?”</p>

<p>Bellair rubbed his eyes, and smiled a little. “I
don’t know what’s the matter with me, but I want
to do something for you. At least, I did want
just that.”</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a thing to talk or think about, I’m
afraid. One starts thinking, and ends by wanting
something&mdash;and I didn’t at first. What I said at
first I meant&mdash;nothing more nor less.”</p>

<p>Her lips tightened. “If you mean just
that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It raked him within. He did not help her by
speaking. Somehow he had expected her to see
that he had meant well. It was always a mystery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>to him how anything fine could be expected of
men, if women were not so.</p>

<p>“Of course, I have to understand,” she added.
“I can do with a poor room and poor food, but
I can’t get anywhere without clothes.... I must
go now.”</p>

<p>“I want you to excuse me if I’ve given you the
idea of my being rich. I’m not, but I might help
you some. How late do you work?”</p>

<p>“One o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Where are you last?”</p>

<p>“At the <i>Castle</i>.”</p>

<p>“And what time do you get there?”</p>

<p>“About eleven-thirty.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there. Sing ‘<i>Maying</i>’ for an encore&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She made believe that she trusted him.</p>

<p>“We’ll sing it at the <i>Castle</i> the last thing,” she
said, leaving hastily.</p>

<p>No ease had come to him. His thoughts now
were not the same as those which had come during
the singing. He tried to put them away. He
didn’t like the idea of giving her money. He
knew that she didn’t expect to see him again;
also that if he did come she would accept the service
of a stranger, and give in return as little as she
could. How explicit she was, already touched
with the cold stone of the world. He did want
to help her, and it had been pure at first. Talk
as usual had broken the beauty of that. Sophistication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and self-consciousness had come; her face
changing more and more as the moments passed
after the song. New York had taught them each
their parts. It had been her thought from the first
that he was looking for prey, but it had been very
far from his.</p>

<p>Bellair was not without imagination. He saw
himself following this girl in a future time, playing
the part he had despised in other men&mdash;the
dumb, slaving, enduring male; she continually
expectant of his services, petulant, unreasonable
without them. For the first time the question
came to him: Is there not a queer sort of conquest
in the lives of such men?... She was for herself;
had it all planned out, the waiting, and what
she would give on the way up, beside her song.
It would not be much; as little as possible, in fact;
but as much as was absolutely demanded. Bellair
in the present state of mind seemed to object to
all this less than what she wanted of the world&mdash;praise
and fame.</p>

<p>“She’s just a little girl after all,” he muttered.
“She ought to have her chance.”</p>

<p>He added (easing the conception a little for
his own peace) that she was only franker and
more outspoken than other women he had known;
that they all wanted money and place, and wanted
men who could furnish such things. Suddenly it
occurred that the incident automatically supplied
the final break with Lot &amp; Company and New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>York. He laughed aloud.... He might borrow
enough in time to make up the amount he
gave her for morning, but that would certainly
be a betrayal of the fiery urge that had whipped
him all week to cross over into a new life and
burn the last bridge.</p>

<p>He took his bags down to the station, arranging
with the landlady to have his goods stored for the
present. After that he rambled, a grateful freshness
in the cool wind. His steps led through
darker streets, where he startled the misery from
the faces of the forbidden who took a chance on
him. Their voices <i>would</i> whine; they couldn’t
help it, and all they wanted in the world was
money.... He was at the <i>Castle</i> before the
quartette came.... They sang and Bellair
dreamed.</p>

<p>He had never made pretence of other than the
commonest lot; yet he conned now an early manhood
that made later years utterly common. He
followed the enticements of the sea, of the future,
the singing-girl never far away, the rest shadows
and sadness.... He must do something for her....
Rich natural tones winged forth from the
breast of a maid, from shoulders so delicate and
white. He would make and keep her great; here
was something to do, to work for. It was like
finding the ultimate secret. He knew now what
had been the matter all the time&mdash;nothing to
work for.... He would stand between her and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>all that he knew was rotten&mdash;the crowds like this
at the <i>Castle</i>, the blurred face of the tenor which
was both sharp and soft, the tired, tawdry soprano,
the stupid animal of a bass. And Bellair, in the
magnanimity of his heart’s effusion, included himself
among the forces of destruction. He would
keep her from the worst of himself, by all means....
She kept her promise, and arose with the
tenor at last:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Oh, that we two were Maying&mdash;&mdash;</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>... New York and all the rest reversed again
in his mind. It wasn’t rotten, but lavish to furnish
everything for money&mdash;so much that men
and women were lost in the offerings, and did
not know what to choose. Yet it was man’s business
to choose. Bellair listened as one across
the world; as if he had been gone a year and was
thirsting and starving to get back. He was literally
longing for New York, with its ramifications
all about him&mdash;yet the thing he wanted, he could
not touch. It was like a sick stomach that infested
his whole nature with desire, while everything
was at hand but the exact nameless thing
desired.... She was like a saint, as she stood
there, her mouth so pure, her features so pretty,
her voice so brave and tireless&mdash;starry to Bellair,
a night-voice with depths and heights
and dew-fragrance. She was coming to
him.</p>

<p>“You look just the same. I wouldn’t take you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>for a New Yorker.... Yes, I am through for
to-night.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d love to sing,” he said.</p>

<p>The remark was fatuous to her. She didn’t
know that a year ago Bellair wouldn’t have dared
to say anything so commonplace, but that he had
come back to this simplicity from the complication
of classics she had never heard of.</p>

<p>“Tell me, what do you want most?” he asked
earnestly. “I don’t mean the need of clothes.
We’ve covered that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I want all that a voice will bring.”</p>

<p>“Great salaries, noise wherever you go, a continual
performance of newspaper articles?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“A score of men praying for favours?”</p>

<p>She sipped warily.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind my question. It isn’t fair. But
tell me, doesn’t it do something to you&mdash;to get
even a man like me going, for instance,&mdash;to make
him all different and full of pictures that haven’t
anything to do with the case?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>He stared at her. “You ought to. You do it.
I’m not talking of art or soul, or any of that stuff.
That isn’t it. I mean just what your singing
amounts to in my case. It means New York, but
not the routine New York&mdash;possibly the New
York that might be. It means <i>Maying</i>&mdash;whatever
that is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>
<p>“You must have been drinking a lot, since I
left <i>Brandt’s</i>,” she said merrily.</p>

<p>He didn’t let it hurt him, and was miserable
anyway. “The fact is, I didn’t take a drink since
Sixth avenue, until a moment ago.”</p>

<p>He saw that she was debating the vital matter
of the evening&mdash;whether he was a piker who must
be shaken presently, or whether he would really
make good on his offer to help in the essentials of
career.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bessie Brealt.”</p>

<p>“And where could I find you, if I wanted to
write?”</p>

<p>He noted her swift disappointment. There
was positive pain in the air. He knew well what
she was thinking, though her sweet face covered
well: that he was about to promise to send the
money to her, that ancient beau business. She
took a last chance, and mentioned a booking
agency that might answer for a permanent address.</p>

<p>“I’ll want to write&mdash;I feel that. And
here, Bessie, if you don’t mind my saying
‘Bessie,’ I can spare a hundred for that
wardrobe. I’d like to do some really big thing
for you.”</p>

<p>He saw tears start to her eyes, but was not carried
out of reason by them. She had wanted the
money fiercely and it had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“How are you going to get home?” he asked,
to relieve the embarrassment.</p>

<p>She glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that I want to take you home,”
he said, shocked by the ugliness of the world that
had called this explanation so hastily. “My train
needs me.... Say, Bessie, men haven’t supplied
you with altogether pleasant experiences so far,
have they?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get a car home.”</p>

<p>He gave her his card.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Better let me get you a cab to-night. It’s
late.”</p>

<p>She thanked him again.... At the curb, as
the driver backed in, Bessie put up her lips to him.</p>

<p>“... Dear singing-girl&mdash;I didn’t ask that.”</p>

<p>“It’s because you didn’t, I think. Really that’s
it. Oh, thank you. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Bellair beckoned another cab, and sank back
into the dark. All the way to the station, and
through to the Savannah-Pullman, he was wrenching
himself clear from something like a passion
to turn about to New York. At the last moment,
before the train moved, he recalled the letter to
Mr. Nathan, and hailed a station porter from
the step.</p>

<p>“Please mail this for me,” he said, bringing up
silver with the letter.</p>

THE JADE: II</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ellair</span> had to wait less than two days
in Savannah, for the <i>Jade</i> had made a
pretty passage. Impressions rushed
home too swift for his mind to follow,
as he stepped aboard from the cotton dock; the
number of impressions, he did not know, until he
began the inventory in his cabin afterward. Last
and first and most compelling, however, was the
spectacle of Stackhouse, that David Hume figure
of a man, reclining in his cane-chair of similar
vast proportions just aft of the main-shrouds. A
momentous hammock of canes, that steamer-chair,
with gentle giving slopes for the calves and broad
containers, polished with wear and tightly woven
like armour, for the arms; a sliding basket for
the head, suggestive of a guillotine’s grisly complement;
the whole adjusted to Stackhouse and
no other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Humid heat in the harbour, a day of soft low
clouds. The man who pushed Brooklyn from
him, had discarded even more thoroughly the
clothing of temperate climes. The vivid black
of his hairy chest was uncovered, and there was a
shining bar of the same, just above the selvage of
white sock. Bellair thought he must be hairy as
a collie dog.... But mainly that which
weighted and creaked the chair seemed an enormous
puddle of faded silks.</p>

<p>The bulky brown head (which arose plumb as
a wall from the back of the neck) had slightly
bowed as Bellair passed. There was something
ox-like in the placidity of the brown eyes, but that
was only their first beam, as it were. Much that
was within and behind the eyes of Stackhouse,
Bellair thought of afterward. Through a deep,
queer process, it came to him that even the answer
for his coming was in that indescribable background;
and restless, too, in the pervading brown,
a movement of sleek animals there. The Japanese
woman had <i>skuffed</i> forward with drink for her
lord.</p>

<p>Over all was the cloud of canvas and rigging,
which Bellair had studied from the land, and
which had forced him to a fine respect for the
ruffian sailor-men who could move directly in such
an arcanum, and command its service. Bellair
had not found such labour on shore, having lost
his respect for the many who did not learn even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>the commonest work.... There was a deep-sea
smell about her, a solution of tar and dried fruit,
paint and steaming coppers from the galley.</p>

<p>The very age of the <i>Jade</i> was a charm to him.
Only her spine and ribs and plates were of steel&mdash;the
rest a priceless woodwork that had come into
its real beauty under the endlessly wearing hands
of man. There seemed a grain and maturity to
the inner parts, as if the strain and roughing of
the seas had brought out the real enduring heart
of the excellent fabric. The rose-wood side-board
of his upper berth, for instance, placed for the full
light from the port to fall upon it, was worth the
price of the passage&mdash;sixteen inches wide, a full
inch and one-half thick, worn to a soft lustre as
if the human hands had hallowed it, and giving
back to the touch the same answer from the years
that a vine brings to stone-work and the bouquet
to wine.... The <i>Jade</i> had known good care and
answered. Floors, even of the cabins, were hollowed
from much stoning; the hinges held and
ferried their burdens in silence, and the old locks
moved with soft contented clicks, the wards running
in new oil.</p>

<p>A city man who had long dreamed of a country
garden; or indeed, Bellair was a city man who had
long dreamed of a full-rigged ship to fulfil in
part the romance of his soul. The <i>Jade</i> had a
dear inner life for him, satisfied him with her
lines, her breathing, settling and repose. A fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>hunger began to animate the length and breadth
of the man.</p>

<p>There was a half hour of straight, clear thinking,
of the kind that plumbs the outlook with the
in, and mainly comes unawares. Bessie Brealt,
of course, appeared and passed, in all the hardness
of her life and the pity of it, but the days that
had elapsed since the parting had not changed his
unique desire to help her; nor did he lie to himself
that he wanted her, too, as a man wants a woman.
He loved her in a way, against his will. Possibly
the kiss had fixed that. In the solution of the
running thoughts, and without subtlety of mingling,
was the face on deck, the dark, extraordinary
face of Stackhouse.</p>

<p>They were a full day at sea, before Bellair was
called to sit down before the great cane chair.
There was a warm land wind; November already
forgotten. The <i>Jade</i> had gathered up her skirts
and was swinging along with a low music of her
own. Stackhouse waddled back to his chair from
the land-rail, a remarkable mass of crumpled silks,
the canes marked in the general effusion of dampness
along his back and legs, the silks caught up
behind by a system of wrinkles and imprints, and
one hitched pantaloon revealing the familiar muff
of fur above the selvage of his fallen sock. Now
Stackhouse was preparing to enter. Bellair was
caught in the tension. The process, while prodigious,
was not without its delicate parts. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>hand was irrevocably occupied with a long-stemmed
China pipe, a warm creamy vase, already
admired by Bellair. Breath came in puffs and
pantings of fragrant tobacco, but there were gurglings
and strange stoppages of air that complained
from deeper passages.</p>

<p>Creaking began at the corners; and a wallowing
as if from the father of all boars. Now the centre
of the chair caught the strain in full and whipped
forth its remonstrance. One after another the
legs gripped the deck, each with a whimper of its
own; and the air was filled with sharp singing tension
which infected the nerves of the watcher.
Suddenly the torso seemed to let go of itself; and
from the canes of the huge central hollow came a
scream in unison. By miracle the whole found
itself once more and the breathing of Stackhouse
subsided to a whine.</p>

<p>“We are entering the latitude of rum,” said
he. “Whoever you are, young man, drink the
drink of nature, and you will brosper.”</p>

<p>The west was just a shore-line, the dusk rising
like a tide. The hand of the owner pressed the
silks variously about his chest, and at last located
a loose match. Nerves were sparsely scattered in
these thick, heavy-fleshed fingers. He had to stop
all talk and memory to direct his feeling. The
match at length emerged from his palm, and slithered
over the fine canes of the arm. It was damp.
Stackhouse rubbed the sulphur delicately in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>hair at his temple and tried again. Fire leaped to
the tip, and poured out from the great hand which
pressed it to the pipe and mothered it from the
wind. From the gurgling passages, smoke now
poured as the sweetness in Sampson’s riddle.</p>

<p>Rum had come. The Japanese woman served
them. The youth of her face chilled Bellair; the
littleness of her, all the tints and delicacy of a
miniature in her whitened face. Bright-hued silk,
a placid smile, the <i>skuffing</i> of her wooden sandals
and the clock-work intricacy of the coils of her
black hair&mdash;these were but decorations of the
tragedy which came home to the American where
he was still tender.... But why should he burn
tissue? She seemed happy. He knew that the
Japanese women require very little to make them
happy; but that little was denied this maiden. An
hour a day to giggle with her girl-friends behind
a lattice, and she might have borne twenty-three
hours of hell with calmness and cheer, not counterfeit
like this.</p>

<p>“You have no true drink of the soil in Ameriga,”
said Stackhouse. “You do not make beer
nor wine, so you make no music. The only drink
and the only music that come from the States of
Ameriga, are from the nigger-folk who do not belong
there. They make music and corn whiskey.
The rest is boison to the soul.”</p>

<p>The voice was rich and mellow. He must have
known Teutonic beginnings, or enough association
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>for the mannerisms to get into his blood. Stackhouse
was not even without that softness of sentiment,
though he was tender only for men. Except
for a spellable word here and there, his accent
was inimitable. He talked of little other than
death, and with indescribable care&mdash;as if he had
been much with men of another language or with
men of slow understanding.... It may have
been the drink, or the sunset over distant land;
the Spanish Main ahead, or the dryness and pentness
of the city-heart and its achievement of long-dreamed
desire in a snug, sweet ship under the
easy strain of sails with wind in them; in any
event Bellair was drawn with exquisite passion&mdash;drawn
southward as the <i>Jade</i> was drawn in the
soft, irresistible strength of nature.</p>

<p>He knew that this would pass, that he could
not continue to sense this <i>rapport</i> with the sea-board,
but he loved it now, breathed deep, and
saw Stackhouse as he was never to be seen again.
There was enchantment in the eyes of the great
wanderer, and a certain culture of its kind in its
stories. Bellair listened and in the gleam of the
broad, dark eyes, there seemed a glimpse of burning
ships, shadowy caravans on moonlit sands
and the flash of arms by night; low-lying lights of
island ports, formless rafts, spuming breakers,
mourning derelicts&mdash;just glimpses, but of all the
gloom and garishness of the sea. He began a
monologue that night, and though it is not this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>story, it was not interrupted except by meals and
sleeping, for many days; and all the pauses in
that story were the dramatic pauses of death:</p>

<p>“... I have travelled more than most travellers
and have seen more than is good for one man.
In New York I saw Brundage of Frisco, who
asked me if I remembered Perry. I said I remembered
very well, for Perry was a bartner of mine,
before young Brundage came out to the Islands.
He told me Perry was six weeks buried. That is
the way now. When I was young, my combanions
did not die in beds. They were killed.
Eight months ago, I saw Emslie&mdash;waved at him
going up the river to Shanghai. He was outward
bound, and came home to us in Adelaide in a
sealed box. Old Foster, who is richer than I, has
married a little Marie in Manila and may die
when he pleases now. The South Seas still run
in and yonder among Island shores, but who buys
wine for the Japanese girls in Dunedin, since
Norcross was conscripted for the service we all
shall know?...</p>

<p>“And thus you come to the <i>Jade</i>, and some
time you will here them dell of Stackhouse. Who
knows but you may dell the story&mdash;of a familiar
face turned down like an oft-filled glass? And
some one will say, ‘He has not laughed these many
years.’ They used to say in the <i>Smilax</i> at Hong
Kong, when the harbour was raving and the seas
were trying to climb the mountain&mdash;they used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>to say that Stackhouse was laughing somewhere
off the China coasts. But there are only so many
laughs in a man, and they go out with the years.
Most of those who said that thing of Stackhouse&mdash;yes,
most of them, are dead as glacial drift.”</p>

<p>Such was the quality of his perorations,
hunched ox-like just aft of the main-shrouds&mdash;the
Japanese woman coming and going with the
ship’s bells, bringing drinks day and night.</p>

<p>“It seared my coppers&mdash;that drinking in the
States of Ameriga. It will not subdue,” said he.
“One has a thirst for weeks after a few days of
drinking in Ameriga. For one must be bolite.”</p>

<p>He was never stimulated, seldom depressed, but
saturated his great frame twenty hours of the
twenty-four, the Japanese woman seeming to understand
with few or no words the whims of taste
of which he was made. Just once in the small
hours, Bellair heard her voice. The cane-chair
had not been empty long, and the silence of soft
rain was upon the deck. Bellair had opened a
package of New York papers purchased on the
last day in Savannah.... It was just one
scream, but the scream of one not frightened by
any human thing.... The roll of papers
dropped down behind the bunk. Anyway, Bellair
could not have read after that. Early in the
morning after hours of torture of dreams, he was
awakened as usual by the sluicing of the monster.
Two Lascars who travelled with Stackhouse apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
for no other purpose, poured pails of
salt water upon him in the early hour when the
decks were washed; and often at midday as they
neared the Line. It was given to Bellair more
than once, as the voyage lengthened, to witness
this hippodrome.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">Her face was continually turned away. Bellair
wondered as days passed if he should
ever see her face to face&mdash;the silent, far-looking
young woman with a nursing baby in her arms.
On deck she stood at the rail, eyes lost oversea.
Her contemplation appeared to have nothing to
do with Europe or America, but set to the wind
wherever it came from, as the strong are always
turned up-stream. Sometimes she wore a little
blue jacket, curiously reminding Bellair of school-days,
and though she was not far from that in
years, she seemed to have passed far into the
world. The child cried rarely.</p>

<p>There was a composure about the mother, but
he did not know if it were stolidity or poise. Certainly
she had known poverty, but health was
in her skin, and there was something in that white
profile, that the sun had touched with olive rather
than tan, that stopped his look. The perfection
of it dismayed Bellair. He loved beauty, but did
not trust it, did not trust himself with it. The
presence of a beautiful face stimulated him as no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>wine could do, but it also started him to idealising
that which belonged to it, and this process had
heretofore brought disappointment. Bellair did
not want this touch of magnetism now. Beauty
was plentiful. He had seen the profiles of Italian
girls in New York, that the Greeks would have
worshipped, and which the early worship of the
Greeks was doubtless responsible for&mdash;beauty
with little beside but giggle and sham. He disliked
the thing in a man’s breast that answers so
instantly to the line and colour of a woman’s face;
objected to it primarily, because it was one of the
first and most obvious tricks of nature for the replenishment
of species in man and below. Bellair
fancied to answer the captivation, if any at all, of
a deeper wonder in woman than the contour of her
countenance.</p>

<p>He was aware that many a woman has a beautiful
profile, whose direct look is a disturbing reconsideration.
This kept his eyes down, when
she was opposite in the dining cabin. We are
strangely trained at table; at no time so merciful.
The human dining countenance must be lovely,
indeed, not to break the laws of beauty. Only
outright lovers dare, and they are bewildered by
each other, and see not. So he did not know the
colour of her eyes.</p>

<p>She nursed her baby often on deck, sitting bare-headed
in the wind and sun, sometimes singing to
it. The singing was all her own; Bellair wished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>she wouldn’t. Her melodies were foreign, and
sometimes it seemed to him as if they were just a
touch off the key. Her low dissonances, he described
vaguely as Russian, but retained the suspicion
that she was tonally imperfect of hearing.</p>

<p>The singing and the picture of her was just as
far as possible from Bessie Brealt, but she made
Bellair think. In all likelihood this was the general
objection. His eyes smarted in the dusks,
as he thought of the other singer (as solitary in
New York as this woman here), who was determined
not to be afraid of the cars or the bears or
the wolves. Every day Bessie’s first words returned
to him:</p>

<p>“A little Rhine wine&mdash;it’s very good here.”</p>

<p>And always the devastation of that sentence
was great. It was a street-woman’s inside
familiarity, <i>Brandt’s</i> being one of her rounds; as
she might speak of the beer at <i>Holbeck’s</i> or the
chops at <i>Sharpe’s</i>. Yet Bessie was not greedy,
and had no taste for wine. It was the glibness,
the town mannerism, and the low, easy level which
her acceptance of the common saying revealed;
the life which she was willing to make her own,
at least exteriorly. But after all, in the better
moments, it seemed very silly to deny a great soul
to the girl who could sing as Bessie sang. Some
day she would feel her soul....</p>

<p>The preacher, third passenger on board the
<i>Jade</i>, reported that the Faraway woman was returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
to her home in New Zealand. Fleury
didn’t know if her baby was boy or girl, but
judged that it was very healthy, since it cried so
little.</p>

<p>Fleury wasn’t promising to Bellair’s eyes.
First of all it was the cloth; and then during the
first three weeks at sea, Bellair spent innumerable
hours in the periphery of the great cane-chair.
He did not resist his prejudice. “A missionary
going out with the usual effrontery,” he decided.
The preacher’s face appeared placid and boyish....
Fleury, however, continued to observe cheerful
good-mornings, to praise the fine weather, and
to offer opportunities for better acquaintance&mdash;all
without being obtrusive in the least. Hayti and
Santo Domingo&mdash;names once remote and romantic
to the city man’s mind&mdash;were now vanished
shores, and as yet the voyage was but well begun....
The three passengers were served together in
the cabin, except in cases when the Stackhouse
narrative happened to be running particularly
well. Bellair would then be called to dine with
the owner. Captain McArliss would appear at
this mess and disappear&mdash;the courses being
brought to him one after another in a certain rapid
form. The Captain seemed so conscious, that Bellair
never quite dared to observe what happened
to the food, but he was certain that McArliss did
not bolt. His suspicion was that he tasted or
sipped as the case might be, merely spoiling the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>offering. He was gone before Stackhouse was
really started.</p>

<p>It was less what the giant ate, than the excessive
formality and importance of his table sessions
that prevailed upon the American. Dinner was
the chief doing of the day. Bellair had never
complained, even in thought, of the food served
to him in the usual mess, but with Stackhouse
everything was extra fine from the Chinese standpoint&mdash;all
delicacies and turns of the art, all
choice cuttings and garnishments, a most careful
consideration of wines&mdash;so that from the first
audible delectation of the contents of the silver
tureen, to the choice of a cigar (invariably after
a few deep inhalations from a cigarette “made in
Acca by the brisoners”), there was formality and
deep responsibility upon the ship; and a freedom
afterward through the galleys that was pleasant
to regard.</p>

<p>“There are many things in Belgium,” said the
master. “There are wines and gookeries there;
also in Poland there are gooks. In England there
are gooks, but not in Ameriga&mdash;only think-they-are-gooks.
However, there are gooks in China. I
have one, as you shall see.”</p>

<p>Something like this at each mighty dining&mdash;and
the promise had to do with the next course
which Stackhouse invariably knew and served as
a surprise for his guest, for he ordered his dinner
with his coffee and fish in the morning. Bellair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>had often seen the Chinese emerge from the galley,
as they came up from the dining saloon, little
sparse patches of hair here and there on his fat
face like willow clumps on the shore, these untouched
by the razor, though his forehead was
perfectly shaven to the queue circlet. This was
Gookery John taking his breath after the moil and
heat of the day.</p>

<p>Stackhouse would declare that he dined just
once a day, meaning this exactly. He breakfasted
on a plate of fried fish with many pourings of
mellow, golden and august German coffee, eating
the hot fishes in his hands like crackers&mdash;a very
warm and shiny hand when it was done&mdash;crisp
brown fishes stripped somehow in his beard, the
bones tossed overside. He liked full day with
this meal. The plates were brought hot and covered
to the great cane chair, until he called for
them to cease. For his supper he desired outer
darkness (English ale and apples, black bread
from Rome that comes sewn in painted canvas
like hams for the shipping, butter from Belgium
packed with the care of costly cheeses, of which
he was connoisseur; sauces of India, a cold chicken,
perhaps, or terrapin, and an hour or two of nuts).
The Japanese woman appeared at none of these
services.</p>

<p>It was the dinners, however, which bewildered
Bellair most. He had not the heart utterly to
condemn them, since the <i>Jade</i> and the noble sea-air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
sometimes winy and sometimes of sterile
purity, kept him in that fine state of appreciation,
which if he had ever known as a boy was
utterly forgotten. He had initiation in curries
and roasts, piquant relishes of seed and fish and
flower, chowders, broiled fish and baked&mdash;until
he felt the seas and continents serving their best,
and learned about each in the characteristic telling
of the man who lived for them. For instance
when chicken was brought:</p>

<p>“These are the birds for the Chinese to play
with&mdash;yes, you would think me joking? It is not
so. The little chicken-birds are kept for pets.
They are not frightened to death. You do not
know, berhaps, that fear and anger boisons the
little birds? They are kept happy and killed
quick&mdash;before they know. Many mornings they
are fed from the hand and played with, until they
love John of the gookeries&mdash;and one morning&mdash;so,
like that&mdash;heads off&mdash;and no boison from the
fear of death in our flavours. Many things you do
not know&mdash;yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bellair said.</p>

<p>Stackhouse loved his little facts like these, all
matters of preparation of fish and flesh and fowl;
the intricate processes of fattening, curing, softening,
corking and all the science of the stores....
“There was a certain goose which I found in
Hakodate&mdash;not from the Japanese, but from a
Chino there&mdash;&mdash;”.... “And once upon a time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>in Mindanao, they baked a fish for me with heated
stones in the ground. Wrapped in leaves, it was,
and covered first in clay. You should see the
scales and skin come off with the clay&mdash;and the
inner barts a little ball, when it was finished. And
the dining of that evening. Ah, the sharb eyes of
the little nigger girls&mdash;you would believe?”....
Such were the stories in the long feeding&mdash;but
the stories on deck were the stories of the death
of men.</p>

<p>In the usual mess the chat was perfunctory on
Bellair’s part, since he granted that the preacher
and the Faraway woman (he called her so in his
thoughts from her distant-searching on deck)
were so well adjusted to each other. He granted
this, and much beside concerning the two, from
pure fancy. Never once had they disregarded
him, or engaged in conversation that would leave
him dangling, though many times his own
thoughts were apart. The <i>Jade</i> had been three
weeks out of Savannah, in the southern Caribbean,
a superb mid-afternoon, when Bellair, turning at
the rail, found Fleury at his side. He had just
been wondering if he had better go below and
read awhile by the open port, or start the monologue
of Stackhouse for the rest of the day. The
latter was enjoyable enough, but Bellair disliked
to drink anything so early.... “One must be
bolite.”</p>

<p>It happened right for the first conversation with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>Fleury. He had never known a preacher whose
talk touched the core of things. Preachers had
always shown a softness of training on the actualities,
and left Bellair sceptical of the rest. A
minister had once told him: “What force for
good we get to be in mid-life, is in spite of our
ecclesiastical training, not because of it.” Bellair
had often thought of that.</p>

<p>Yet, he had given much secret thought to religious
things, not counting himself a specialist,
however, seldom opening the subject. Certainly
at Lot &amp; Company’s, no one had marked this proclivity.
He had the idea that a man must come
up through men, and through the real problems
of men, if he would become a moving force for
good in the world; that no training apart among
texts and tracts and tenets would get him power.
Very clearly he saw that a man must go apart to
fix his ideals, but that he should seek his wilderness
after learning the world, not after prolonged
second-hand contacts with books.</p>

<p>“The big job ahead is for some one who can
show the human family that it’s all of a piece,
and that we’re all out after the same thing,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“A Unifier,” Fleury suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes. Just so long as we have to hate one cult
or sect, because we love another, we’re lost to the
whole beauty of the scheme&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you,” said the preacher.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p>“What is your church?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, I haven’t one,” Fleury said
with a smile. “Convictions somewhat similar to
that which you have expressed have twice cost me
my church. As the church puts it, I am a failure
and not to be trusted with regular work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are going out in the mission-service?”</p>

<p>Bellair was now ashamed, because he had held
the other a bit cheaply. The boyish face looked
suddenly different to him, as Fleury said:</p>

<p>“No&mdash;that is, I have ceased to expound theology.
I have come out to make the thought and
the act one.”</p>

<p>Bellair was taking on a new conception. His
question was a trifle automatic:</p>

<p>“Did you talk out in meeting?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There were a thousand years in the congregation.
You know what I mean&mdash;only a few
of our generation in method of mind.”</p>

<p>“A sort of Seventeenth century average?” Bellair
suggested.</p>

<p>“Don’t misunderstand me. I was wrong, too,”
Fleury declared. “Wrong, in the young man’s
way of thinking himself right. You know we’re
just as baneful when we are getting into a new
world of thought as when we are not yet out of
the old. It’s only after we have settled down and
got accustomed to the place, that we’re reasonable.
A man should be big enough to talk to all men,
and appear everlastingly true to the least and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>greatest. Truth is big enough for that. I had
only a different trail from theirs, and wanted them
all to come to mine, forgetting that the trails are
only far apart at the bottom of the mountain&mdash;that
they all converge at the top&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You had to be honest with yourself,” Bellair
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I thought, but maybe there
was a lie in that,” Fleury answered. “It’s not so
easy to be honest with one’s self and keep on using
words for a living. The best way is to act&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ve said something, Mr. Fleury.”</p>

<p>And in his new respect for the other, Bellair
wanted to make his view clearer. “It’s the old
soil and seed story again,” he said. “It isn’t
enough to get truth down to superb simplicity.
The minds of men must be open beside. My
objection to the Church is that it has separated
religion from work and the week-day&mdash;tried to
balance one day of sanctimoniousness against six
days of mammon&mdash;taught men that heaven is to
be reached in a high spiritual effusion because One
has died for us. The fact is we’ve got to help
ourselves to heaven.... Excuse me for being so
communicative,” he added, “but what you said
about putting down talk and taking up action
interested me at once. I’ve a suspicion you won’t
be long in finding something to do&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping just that.”</p>

<p>Fleury smiled at him. The face was large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>and mild, not a fighter’s face nor a coward’s
either.... The young woman appeared with
the child. She seemed to hold it to the sun, and
she walked with the beauty of a woman bringing
a pitcher to the fountain. Bellair realised the
heat of the day. Her face had an intense clearness,
but was partly turned away. There was a
delicacy about it that he had not known before.
He recalled that she had just bowed to them....
They were passing an island shore&mdash;a line of
sun-dazzle that stung the eyes, empty green hills
and a fierce white sky. Bellair thought of the
woman and the island as one ... he, the third,
coming home, mooring his boat, hastening up the
trail at evening.... Her frail back, bending a
little to the right, made him think of a dancer
he had once seen. He saw the child’s bare limbs
in the sun.... His steps were quickened up that
Island trail again.... The <i>Jade</i> seemed fainting
in the cushions of hot wind. Just then a voice
said:</p>

<p>“She’s quite the most remarkable woman. She
isn’t a talker.”</p>

<p>He had forgotten Fleury.</p>

<p>“Where is she going?”</p>

<p>“Auckland. She came from there.”</p>

<p>“Queer, she would go home this way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Her whole fortune is in her arms,” Fleury
whispered.</p>

<p>The ship’s bell struck twice; the cane-chair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>creaked; they turned by habit to note the appearance
of the Japanese woman with drink. She did
not fail. Stackhouse came to with a prolonged
snore, a sound unlike a pair of pit-terriers at work.</p>

<p>“A considerable brute,” muttered the preacher.</p>

<p>“He has been much of a man in his way,” said
Bellair.</p>

<p>“He talks much&mdash;that is weakness.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Bellair began to understand
how deeply the other’s experience had bitten him.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of death,” Fleury added.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Bellair mused. “He talks always
of death. He’s been in at the deaths of many
men. He’ll die hard himself&mdash;if he doesn’t tame
down.”</p>

<p>Fleury added: “When a man is so much an
animal, all his consciousness is in that. They
see death as the end&mdash;that’s why they are
afraid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is a coward?” Bellair questioned.</p>

<p>“The stuff animals are made of cannot last,”
the preacher concluded.</p>

<p>Bellair pondered as he sat with Stackhouse
that night. Brandy was the choice of the evening.
The Japanese woman brought it from the deeps
of the hold, where it had come in stone from
Bruges. Bellair joined him a second and a third
time for the instant stinging zest of the fire....
Fleury and the woman had long stood together aft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>by the clicking log. The moon came late and
bulbous. Stackhouse talked of his fortune, and
the chaos in many island affairs his death would
cause.... Once he had loved a chap named
Belding, and would have left him great riches,
but Belding was dead....</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">They had crossed the Line. The night was
windless hot&mdash;almost suffocating below. Bellair
gave it up, a little after midnight, and
went on deck, moving forward out of the smell of
paint, for the heat had bubbled the lead on the
cabin planking. A few first magnitude stars
glinted in the fumy sky. The anchor chains and
the big hook itself made a radiator not to be
endured&mdash;better the smell of paint than that.
Captain McArliss moved past with a cigar and
suggested jerkily that a hammock was swung aft
by the binnacle. Bellair thanked him and went
there, but did not lie down. Close to the rail he
could smell the deep and it refreshed him. Left
alone in this hard-won ease, his thoughts turned
back to New York.</p>

<p>... It was like a ghost at the companionway&mdash;a
faint grey luminosity. She came toward
him without a sound, the child in her arms. Something
of the strangeness prevented him speaking
until she was near, and then he spoke softly in
fear lest she be frightened:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“It is I, Bellair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>If she were startled, she did not let him know.
He offered the deckchair he had occupied, or the
hammock, as she chose.</p>

<p>“I would not have disturbed you,” she said.</p>

<p>“I think it is cooler close to the rail,” he suggested.
“The little one is very brave. Is he
awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I said ‘he,’&mdash;the fact is, I
didn’t know,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“You were right,” she answered, sitting down.
“He seems to have so much to study and contemplate.
It passes the time for him, and then he
is very well and he likes the sea.”</p>

<p>“He has been to sea before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we came up from Auckland on a steamer
when he was <i>ver-ee</i> little, but he liked it, and did
so well. It was harder for him in New York,
although he didn’t complain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair laughed.</p>

<p>“Now that I have taken your seat&mdash;won’t you
get another?” she asked. “Or the hammock?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind I should be very glad to
get another chair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair found himself hurrying to the waist, for
there was always a lesser seat by the great cane
throne.... He could not see her face in that
utter night, but sometimes when he had forgotten
for a moment, there seemed the faintest grey haze
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>about her face and shoulders, but never when he
looked sharply; and the curve of her back as her
body fitted to the child in her lap, hushed him
queerly within, so that he listened to his own
commonplace words, as one would hear the remarks
of another.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he would come to me?” the
man asked.</p>

<p>“I think he would be very glad,” she said.</p>

<p>Bellair took no risk, but placed his hand softly
between the little ones. Something went out of
him, leaving nothing but a queer, joyous vibration
that held life together, with ample to spare to
laugh with. The larger part of his identity
seemed to be infused with the night, however. On
one side of his hand, there was a warm, light
seizure, rendering powerless his own little finger,
and on the other side, his thumb was taken. He
lifted his hand a little and the captor’s came with
it&mdash;no waste of energy whatsoever, but with easy
confidence of having enough and to spare. The
man couldn’t breathe without laughing, but he
was very quiet about it as the moment demanded,
and his delight was nowise to be measured in
recent history.</p>

<p>He was bending forward close to the woman’s
breast. Suddenly he remembered her&mdash;as if finding
himself in a sanctuary.... The great pictures
of the world had this <i>motif</i>, but the Third
of the trinity was always invisible. Yet he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>entered in this darkness, come right into the fragrance
and the love-magnetism of it ... held
there in two ineffable pressures.</p>

<p>His low laughter ceased. He was full of wonder
now, but could not stay. Out of the bewilderment
of emotions he had the one sense&mdash;that he
was not the third to this mystery&mdash;that the third
must be invisible, as in the great <i>madonnas</i> of
paint. He betrayed the tiny grips with a twist,
caught the child in his two hands and lifted him
from the mother, sitting back in his own chair....
But the fragrance lingered about him and
that wonderful homing vibration. He knew something
of the nature of it now. It was peace.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">4</p>

<p class="no-indent">The little blue jacket had come forth again
as they ran down into the cold.... There
was wild weather around the Horn, and Stackhouse
was a sick monster from confinement. Bellair,
who could drink a little for company through
the glorious nights on deck, bolted from the cabin
performance, and Captain McArliss was called
to listen, and fell, as Stackhouse knew he would,
for he had said to Bellair during one of their last
talks:</p>

<p>“Lest there appear among men a perfect sailor,
they handicapped my McArliss&mdash;packed his inner
barts in unslaked lime. Never will you see a
thirst fought as he fights it. First he will drink
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>with me, and you will hear him laugh; then he
will drink alone, and there will be silence until he
begins to scream. Already his eyes are tortured
and his lips white. Bresently he will come and
sit with me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair hated this; in fact the big master had
begun to wear deeply. “I should think you would
want to keep him on his feet&mdash;for the passage
around the Horn.”</p>

<p>“My McArliss is always a sailor,” said Stackhouse,
rocking his head.</p>

<p>Bellair could credit that. McArliss interested
him&mdash;an abrupt, nervous man, who covered the
eager warmth of his friendliness in frosted mannerisms
and sentences clipped at each end. He
was afraid of himself except in his work, afraid
of his opinions, though a great reader of the queer
out of the way good things. Bellair found Woolman’s
Life in his little library, with narratives of
the ocean, tales of Blackbirders and famous Indiamen,
Lytton’s “Strange Story” and “Zanoni,” also
Hartmann’s “Magic, Black and White.” The
latter he read, and found it not at all what he
expected, but a book that would go with him as
far as he cared at any angle, and then lose him.
He was quite astonished. It was a long book, too&mdash;the
kind you vow you will begin again, from
time to time through the last half. He wanted to
talk to McArliss about it, but the Captain was
embarrassed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>
<p>“Crazy, eh?” he would say with a queer, dry
laugh.</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped saying that about a book&mdash;because
I don’t get it all,” Bellair remarked. “This
man is right as far as I can go with him.”</p>

<p>“You give him the benefit&mdash;eh? That’s pretty
good.”</p>

<p>“And you like it?”</p>

<p>“Ha&mdash;it passes the time. Good God&mdash;we have
to pass the time!”</p>

<p>He spoke jerkily, always in this fashion, and
the days brought no ease to the tension. McArliss
patted his pockets, swore hastily over little
things, looked snappily here and there. Bellair
would have guessed, without the word from Stackhouse.
The Captain was fighting hard. There
seemed nothing to be done; the man had grown a
spiked hedge around an innocent shyness; all that
was real about him he kept shamefacedly to himself.
Still Bellair believed more and more in his
fine quality. McArliss made a picture for him
of one who has come up through steam and returned
to canvas bringing a finer appreciation to
the beauty and possibilities of natural seamanship;
as a man returns to the land, after many
wearing years of city life, with a different and
deeper instinct of the nature of the soil.</p>

<p>“She’s a slashing sailer,” he would say critically,
as he crowded the <i>Jade</i>. “She balances to
a hair&mdash;eh? Good old girl&mdash;they don’t breed her
kind any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>It was he who balanced her to every wind,
meeting all weathers with different cuts of cloth.
Having only a distant familiarity with his fellow-officers
and not even a speaking acquaintance with
the crew, McArliss made her sing her racing song
night and day down into the lower latitudes, until
one played with the suspicion that he managed
the weather, too,&mdash;with that same nervous, effective
energy. It was all tremendously satisfying
to Bellair. He had reacted on the last reaction,
and was healed throughout. Worldliness was lost
from his mental pictures of Bessie; daily she became
more as he wanted her to be. Lot &amp; Company
had lost its upstanding and formidable black&mdash;was
far-off now and dimly pitiable. He had
not cared what was ahead; it had been the <i>Jade</i>
and the voyage that had called him, but now the
Islands and all that watery universe of the Southern
Pacific were in prospect, to explore and make
his own. Perhaps men were younger there; trade
less old and ramified; perhaps they would bring
him the new magic of life&mdash;so that he could live
with zest and be himself.... Always at this
part of the dream he would think of Bessie again.
She was the cord not yet detached. Sooner or
later, he must go back to her. At times he thought
that he could not bear to remain very long; sometimes
even watching this endless passage of days
with strange concern.... But there was a short
cut home&mdash;straight up the Pacific to San Francisco&mdash;and
four days across....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>
<p>Fleury and the Faraway woman had their increasingly
fine part in his life. The preacher was
always finding some new star, or bidding adieu
to some northern constellation.</p>

<p>They had chosen the passage through the Straits
because of the settled weather. At least, they
called it fair-going&mdash;wild and rugged though it
was, with huge masses of torn cloud, black or
grey-black, hurtling past, often as low as the
masthead, and all life managed at sick angles.
The <i>Jade</i> bowed often and met the screaming
blasts with her poles strangely bare, except, perhaps,
for a few feet of extra-heavy canvas straining
at the mizzen weather-rig.... Stackhouse
nudged him one night and a laugh gurgled up
from his chest as he pointed forward where McArliss
stood in the waist lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>“He will not sleep to-night. He will come to
me&mdash;and you will never hear such talk as from
this silent man. He will look for gompany to-night.
One must be bolite.”</p>

<p>It was true. McArliss apparently fell into the
cigarettes first, or perhaps he had fallen deeper.
Bellair did not join them in the cabin, but heard
their voices. The next day McArliss hunted him
up, an inconceivable action. This was not like
timid Spring, but sudden redolent summer after
the austerities. The man was on fire, but perfectly
in hand. All that he had thought and kept
to himself for months appeared to come forth now&mdash;books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and men, the great oceans of spirit and
matter, and the mysteries of life and release. It
seemed as if his body and brain had suddenly become
transparent. The Captain was happy and
kind, without oath or scandal, full of colour and
romance; returning with excellent measure all the
good thoughts that Bellair had given to him, and
showing forth for one rare forenoon the memorable
fabric of a man.</p>

<p>There was no repetition to his stages. In the
afternoon he passed Bellair brusquely, and drank
the night away with Stackhouse. The next day
both face and figure had a new burden; the real
man was now imprisoned more effectively than
even his sobriety could accomplish.... Then
the descent day by day&mdash;the narrow, woman’s
waist and the broad, lean shoulders becoming a
hunched unit, face averted, hands thick. Bellair
always felt that Stackhouse was in a way responsible&mdash;for
the old Master had known what would
come and lured it on. He had foretold each
stage&mdash;even to the last of McArliss drinking
alone.</p>

<p>On two nights Fleury was with him while he
met his devils. He had outraged Bellair at every
offer and entrance. Even Stackhouse was surprised
that the preacher was permitted to attend.
His poor vitality at length began to crawl back
into his body with terrible pain and shattered sanity&mdash;that
old familiar battle, the last of many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>storms. And now the <i>Jade</i> was sailing up into the
summer of the southern ocean. Midwinter in
New York and here a strange, spacious sort of
June, not without loneliness and wonderment to
Bellair for the steady brightness and exceeding
length of day.</p>

<p>The new moon had come down, extraordinary
in its earth-shine which Fleury explained. The
<i>Jade</i> was marking time, just making steerage
headway, the breeze too light for good breathing....
To-night (as had happened a dozen times
before on the other side of South America before
the cold weather) Stackhouse had begun his story
with, “It was a night like this&mdash;&mdash;” As of old
it was the tale of man and death, of the Stackhouse
escape from death, sinuously impressing the
Stackhouse courage and cleverness. Not that the
story was without art; indeed, as usual, it was
such a one as a man seldom leaves until the end;
but Bellair had long since reached the moment of
sufficiency. He had come to the end of his favourite
author; had begun to see the mechanism
and inventional methods of the workmanship.
Vim was lost for the enactment of Stackhouse’s
fiercer strength. The man was a concentrated
fume of spirit, every tissue falsely braced, his very
life identified with the life and heat of decay....</p>

<p>Alone, Bellair glanced about before going below.
A breeze had slightly quickened the ship
in the last hour. There may have been a dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>nights of equal mystery but this he appreciated
more soundly and was grateful for freedom. His
mind answered the beauty of it all ... something
of this, he might be able to tell Bessie in a
letter. The stars were far and tender; the air
heavenly cool and soft, the night high, and the
ship’s full white above, had something to do with
angels&mdash;a dreamy spirit-haunt about it all. He
would always see the <i>Jade</i> so, as he would see the
Captain in that wonderful forenoon of his emancipation&mdash;poor
McArliss who had not been on
deck for days.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, with paper before him
in his berth, Bellair was deep in the interpretation
of his heart, when the <i>Jade</i> struck the cupola of
a coral castle, and hung there shivering for five
seconds. It was like a suspension of the law of
time.</p>

<p>Bellair thought of Bessie, of every one on the
ship, beginning with Fleury and the New Zealand
woman, and ending with Captain McArliss and
the owner’s Japanese wife. These latter two were
strangely rolled into one, as their images came.
He thought of the ship’s position somewhere in
the great emptiness between the Strait of Magellan
and Polynesia. He re-read the last line of
the letter before him. It had to do with the real
help he hoped to be in Bessie’s cause <i>within the
year</i>. He heard the running and the hard-held
voices on deck, and one great bellowing cry from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>Stackhouse. He knew now that all the tales were
the low furies of fear; that the movement he had
seen first in the eyes of the great animal were the
movements of fear....</p>

<p>And then the <i>Jade</i> slid off the reef with a rip
more tragic than the strike.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">5</p>

<p class="no-indent">Hissing and sucking began below, and the
drawing of the centre of the earth. Bellair
felt this in his limbs, and the limp paralysis
of the sails. It was like the blind struggle in the
soul of a bird, this strain in the entity of the old
<i>Jade</i> to retain her balance between earth and
sky.... Bellair was on his knees dragging forth
his unused case. The roll of New York papers
came with it, and he stuffed them in overcoat
pockets with a six-shooter, a bottle of whiskey and
a few smaller things. These arrangements were
made altogether without thought. Unfumblingly,
he obeyed a rush of absurdities that seemed obvious
and reasonable as in a dream.</p>

<p>The touch of water on his knee as he arose was
like a burn. It poured in under the door, its
stream the size of a pencil, a swift and quiet little
emissary. It occurred&mdash;a queer, rational touch&mdash;that
the <i>Jade</i> could not be thus filled so soon, that
something must have overturned. He opened the
door to the deck. Night and ocean were all one;
the rest was the stars, and this bit of chaos recoiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
from its death&mdash;a little ship, struck from the
deep and perceiving her death like a rat that has
been struck by a rattler. He smelled the sea,
as one in a night-walk smells the earth when passing
a ravine.</p>

<p>He moved aft toward the voices, without yet
having thought of his own death. He passed a
leaking water-cask, and this reminded him of his
thirst. He took a deep drink&mdash;all he could&mdash;and
his thoughts came up to the moment. At the
same time, that which had been a mass of inarticulate
sounds cleared into a more or less coherent
intensity of action.</p>

<p>He heard that the <i>Jade</i> was sinking, but knew
that already; heard that she would be under in
five minutes, which was news of the first order
of sensation.... Now he heard Stackhouse
again; the rich unctuous voice gone, a sharp, dry
<i>peaking</i> instead.... They were aft at the binnacle&mdash;Stackhouse,
Fleury, the Faraway Woman,
McArliss. The Japanese woman was hurrying
forward with a pitcher of wine. Stackhouse drank
from the pitcher, standing, and with greed that
flooded his chest. He spoke and the Japanese
woman vanished.</p>

<p>Bellair saw the face of McArliss in the white
ray from the binnacle. He had scarcely seen the
Captain for a week. Last seen, it was a face
swollen and flaming red. It was yellow now, like
the skin of a chicken, and feathered with patches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>of white beard. The loose eye-lids were touched
with blue. He fumbled with a cigarette, and
called hysterically to an officer amidships. He
was not broken from the tragedy, but from the
debauch.</p>

<p>Stackhouse was standing by the small boat
when two sailors came to launch it. He rocked
from one foot to another and peaked to them incessantly.
Fleury and the woman stepped nearer
the boat. They moved together as one person....
Bellair saw Stackhouse raise his hands as he
had done that first Sunday, pushing Brooklyn
from him. His body pressed against the gunwale
of the small boat; he caught it in his hands, as
it raised clear, his ridiculous ankles alternately
lifting.</p>

<p>His Chinese cook rushed forward with cans of
crackers, and dumped them in the boat. The
Japanese woman appeared dragging a huge hamper
of wines and liquors. Stackhouse took the
hamper between his legs and sent her back to his
cabin. The boat was lowered just below the level
of the <i>Jade’s</i> gunwale. Stackhouse sprawled forward,
the hairy masses of his legs writhing after.
Presently he reversed, and began to reach for the
hamper. Fleury kicked it out of reach, and lifted
the woman and child in.</p>

<p>“Get water,” he said to Bellair. “I’ll save a
place for you.”</p>

<p>Bellair tossed his overcoat into the boat and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>darted to the galley, where he found cans. Filling
them seemed a process interminable, until he
pulled over the half-filled cask.... Stackhouse
was screaming for his hamper. The Japanese
woman sped by with more bottles. She tried to
put them in the boat, but Fleury took them from
her, and attempted to force her into a place, but
she had heard a final command from her lord and
broke away.... Bellair was filling his cans a
second time.... Stackhouse, who had risen insanely,
was rocked back either by word or blow
from Fleury. The small boat was on the sea, and
the <i>Jade’s</i> rail leaned low to it. The sea was
roaring into the mother-boat; she would flurry in
an instant.</p>

<p>“Yes, water, Bellair,” said Fleury. “But don’t
go back.”</p>

<p>“One more trip,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>He filled the last can&mdash;his mind holding the
image of Stackhouse on his knees praying to
Fleury for his hamper. Beseechings back in the
dark accentuated the picture. Fleury was calling
for him.... He passed the Japanese woman,
sobbing and <i>skuffing</i> pitifully back to the cabin;
as a child sent repeatedly for something hard to
find. He heard the launching of the other and
larger boat forward; saw at the binnacle McArliss
still fumbling for a match. Then Fleury grasped
him and his can.... No, it was the woman’s
hand that saved the can from overturning. Bellair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
would have waited for the Japanese woman,
but the <i>Jade</i> dipped half-over and slid him into
the boat.</p>

<p>The mother-ship shuddered. The Japanese
woman passed the binnacle, holding something
high in her hand. She was on her knees....
There was a flare and the face of McArliss&mdash;who
had struck his match at last.... The <i>Jade</i>
seemed to go from them&mdash;a sheet of grey obscured
the rail. The two who remained were
netted there together, the red point of the cigarette
flickered out.... The two boats were on the
sea; the night, a serenity of starlight.... The
sound of slobbering turned their eyes to Stackhouse,
who was drinking from one of the large
cans.... Fleury went to him, pressed the face
from it, and placed the cans forward at the feet
of the woman. His hand was sticky afterward, as
if with blood, and he held it overside.</p>

THE OPEN BOAT</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ellair</span> was athirst. The fact that he had
taken a deep drink less than a half-hour
before, did not prevail altogether against
it. In the very presence of Stackhouse
there was a psychological intensity of thirst. The
master sat hunched and obscene in the stern of
the boat, patting the wet folds of his shirt&mdash;a
pure desire-body, afraid of death, afraid of
thirst, afraid of the fear of thirst and death.
Picturesqueness and personality were gone from
him; romance and the strange culture of the man,
for the eyes of Bellair; the old wonder, too, which
the seas and the islands of the seas had given him.
Bellair could not forget the ankles, the moving
of those bare masses up and down, as Stackhouse
had clung at the same time to the small boat and
the gunwale of the <i>Jade</i>. What a poison to past
tales&mdash;this present passion and method of self-salvation.<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
He was less than a beast, in retaining
the effigy of a man.</p>

<p>Bellair turned to Fleury. Like swift pleasant
rays in the dark, the last scenes of the main-deck
recurred. Again he marvelled at the falsity of
his first judgments, by which he had formerly
set so much, and so complacently. It had seemed
a fat face to him at first, a face out of true with
the world, the face of an easy man who placates
things as they are, because he was not trained to
see the evil of them and give them fight. All
that was remembered with difficulty, even for
this moment of contrast. It would not come
again. Fleury had stood up in the crisis, a man
to tie to. He would never be the same again in
look or action or intonation; as Stackhouse could
never be the same. Fleury had risen and put
on a princely dimension; the other had lost even
that uncertain admirableness of gross animalism.</p>

<p>The preacher was leaning forward toward the
knees of the woman, talking to the babe. Bellair
imagined its eyes wide-open and sober; certainly
it was still. The mother’s face was partly turned
away. Fleury said:</p>

<p>“He is having his adventures. He will be a
great man. He will have the world at his finger-tips,
when he is as old as we are&mdash;and then his
real work will begin. For when we know enough
of the world, we turn to God.”</p>

<p>The note of the preacher in this did not embarrass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Bellair, as it would have done before the
<i>Jade’s</i> sinking.</p>

<p>“He will be a great power,” Fleury went on,
for the heart of the mother. “These things which
for him pass unconsciously, will form him nevertheless.
They will do their work within; and
when he is grown he will know what to do and
say.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” the mother asked.</p>

<p>“Chiefly because I believe in you,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I want him to live,” she said.</p>

<p>“We want that, too,” said Fleury.</p>

<p>Bellair felt himself nodding in the dark.</p>

<p>“If he is to be a great man, he will have to live
through his first&mdash;at least, through this adventure.”</p>

<p>The meaning came very pure to Bellair. It
had to do with crackers and water for the nourishment
of the child. So strong and sure was her
own fortitude that she did not need to say she was
thinking only of food and drink for him. It
meant to Bellair, “If I cannot nurse him, he will
die.”</p>

<p>He regarded the length and beam of the small
boat. It was not more than eighteen feet long&mdash;and
only the Polar seas could be emptier than
this vast southern ocean. The nights would be
more easily endured, but the days, one long burning.
Still it would not be torrid heat; they were
too far south for that. The thought of storm, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>kept in the background of his mind. They all did.
Roughly estimated, there was food and water
enough for them to live without great agony for
a week, possibly for a day or two over, but Stackhouse
was not a part of this consideration. He
could not live a week without an abnormal consumption
of water....</p>

<p>Fleury was talking about the stars. They
would see Venus before dawn, he said; the great
one in their meridian now was Jupiter. “If we
had a marine-glass, we would be able to see his
moons.... That,” he pointed to the brightest
of the fixed stars, a splendid yellow gleam in the
east, “that is Canopus, never seen north of the
Gulf States at Home. It’s so mighty that our
little earth would turn molten in ten seconds if
it came as near as our sun.”</p>

<p>Bellair leaned toward him listening. The
preacher pointed out the Southern Cross, and
Alpha Centauri, almost the nearest of the sun’s
neighbours.</p>

<p>Their thoughts groped naturally to such things.
In the full realisation of their helplessness, they
looked up. The background was a deep fleckless
purple. Bellair hadn’t known the great stars of
the northern skies, much less these splendid
strangers. The brimming closeness of the dark sea
harrowed the landsman’s heart of him; and there
was something as great or greater than the actual
terror of ultimate submerging. It was the fear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>of the fear; the same that causes men to leap from
high places through the very horror of the thought
of leaping. The water lapped the clinkered sides
of the small boat. He touched it. His flesh took
from the coolness something that numbed the
pervading alarm; a message which the wet hand
sensed, but the brain could not interpret. The
presence of the others forward sustained him;
Stackhouse in the stern was the downpull; thus
Bellair was in the balance.</p>

<p>It was yet far from dawn; certainly no lighter,
but Bellair could see better. The woman was
looking away. He knew that he would see her
so, until the last day of her life&mdash;that profile of
serene control, that calm, far-seeing gaze....
What gave her this quiet power?... Already
the thoughts of the three were intimate matters
to all. It seemed very natural now to ask Fleury
what gave the woman such strength.</p>

<p>“It’s the sense that all is well, in spite of this
physical estrangement from the world,” the
preacher said. “Bellair, it’s the sense that nothing
matters but the soul. It’s not belief; it’s knowing.
She has lost the sense of self. <i>She is through
talking.</i> It is finished with her. We talk, because
it is not finished in us&mdash;but it is being accomplished.
We talk because we want that peace;
when it comes we will not talk, but live it. It is
exactly opposite to <i>desire</i>; you can see that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Yes, Bellair could see that. He had but to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>turn back in his seat to confront Stackhouse
wringing his heavy twitching hands and begging
for water, begging like a leper, now that a face
turned to him&mdash;the most frightful picture of the
work of desire and the fear of desire, that the
world or the underworld could furnish. Less than
two hours before he had drunk a quart and wasted
a pint in his greed; and behind Bellair was the
silent woman and Fleury, thinking of others, full
of the good of the world.... In the worldliness
that came to him from Stackhouse, the intimacy
of the matter they had just talked about seemed
startling.</p>

<p>“One can’t help but notice what <i>you get from
somewhere</i>&mdash;and what the woman has,” Bellair
added.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were in the grey mystery of dawn&mdash;alone,
for they had drifted, and the sailors in
the other boat had begun to row at once. Stackhouse
was lifted a little, brought nearer, possibly
by the tension, which they all came to know so
well&mdash;the tension of that grey hour, before the
day reveals the sea.</p>

<p>“It was my ship,” he whimpered. “It was my
hamber&mdash;McArliss was mine and the service&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d have had them all yet, but you amused
yourself watching poor McArliss fall into the
drink. You would have had it all&mdash;just the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>this morning&mdash;for he would never have hit the
reef on duty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was Bellair who spoke, and the thing had
suddenly appeared very clear to him. Stackhouse
did not falter from the present, his huge
head darting east and west to stare through the
whitening film.</p>

<p>“It was my hamber. There is room here at
my feet. It was little, yet meant so much. I
should not have troubled you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The lack of it seemed suddenly to hurt him
even more poignantly.</p>

<p>“You will all go to hell with your talk of
beace,” he declared, looking between them but
at no pair of eyes. “I will go first, what with
the drink dying out, but you will not be long.
There is hell for me, but for all alike. You may
live days&mdash;but the longer, the more hell. And
you will all come at last&mdash;to the long deep drink
of the brine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Stackhouse,” said Bellair. “It
may not turn out so badly. You’ve had luck before.
You’ve talked much to me of luck&mdash;and
deaths of others. If it’s your turn&mdash;face it as
your innumerable friends faced it.”</p>

<p>The man was undone before them. The flesh
of his jaws stood out, as if pulled by invisible
fingers. His heavy lips rubbed together, so that
they turned from the sight of them.</p>

<p>“There was room in the boat for that basket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>of rum,” he called out insanely. “It was all to
me. There is no talk of God for me&mdash;rum was
all I had!... I would have been so quiet. It
would have been here at my feet, but for that
fool who talks of God, and can never know the
thirst of men.”</p>

<p>Fleury turned to him, his face deeply troubled.
It occurred to Bellair that there was something
to what Stackhouse said. Fleury, in kicking back
the hamper, had kept the devil of Stackhouse
from entering the boat, and Stackhouse served
no other.... More and more it was twisting
his brain, as young alligators twist at a carcass.</p>

<p>“I would have had it here between my knees.
And I would have had the little bottle from the
cabin&mdash;the last that boots you to sleep&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so that is what you sent her back for&mdash;sent
her to her death&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You lie. She was held here&mdash;trying to get
the hamber to me. There would have been time.
She would have gone and come. She would have
been here now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair and Fleury glanced at each other.</p>

<p>“I am rotted with drink&mdash;and will drink the
brine first, but you will follow me. You will
bring it up with your hands and drink&mdash;and
drink&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was looking at Fleury now. The intensity
of thirst in the spectacle of him&mdash;the presence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>that vast galvanism of thirst&mdash;was like a burning
sun in their throats. The baby cried, and the
mother drew him shudderingly to her breast.
Fleury swallowed hard, his face haggard and
drawn in the daybreak. He went over and took
his seat before the monster. Bellair was tempted
to ask him to be easy, but there was no need.
Fleury turned and drew a cup of water and handed
it to the other. Bellair’s jaws ached cruelly from
the drain of empty glands.</p>

<p>“We should pity you, Stackhouse,” he said,
“but we are not facing death now. You fill the
boat with thirst&mdash;you fill the sea&mdash;with your
thinking drink and talking drink&mdash;until you bring
a cry of thirst to the little child. It’s as if we
had gone sixty hours&mdash;instead of six&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He talked on for the sake of the woman. Stackhouse
drank and grew silent. Bellair felt better
and braver&mdash;even though the full light revealed
nothing but empty sea and heavenly sky.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair surveyed his world as the dawn came up....
Thirst and fasting; possibly, the end....
The peculiar part of his open boat contemplations,
no two were alike. Physical denial
hurried him from one plane to another from
which he regarded his world&mdash;his two worlds, for
Stackhouse behind was one, and his friends forward,
another; the one drawing his love, courage
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>and finest ideals; the other, repression of self, lest
he wear himself out in hatred. They were not
talkers in front. He had not seen quite the entire
fulfilment of Fleury’s meaning about talking until
late moments. The Faraway Woman invariably
said little; the child was the silentest of all;
Fleury had met this demon and put it away.
Stackhouse had talked and talked, and to the
pictures he made with words, he belonged not
at all, but to unspeakable things. Bellair remembered
his own talk to Filbrick. It made him
writhe. He had become crossed and complicated
and ineffective that day. He had not talked in
the straight line of heart and brain. He saw that
a man who talks that which he is not, is less than
nothing, as Stackhouse was less than nothing.</p>

<p>“How far are we from anywhere, Bellair?”
Fleury asked.</p>

<p>“We weren’t supposed to strike land before
Chatham or Bounty Island&mdash;two days’ sail this
side of New Zealand, as I understand it. We lost
land six&mdash;a week ago to-day&mdash;<i>Madre de Dios</i>,
McArliss called it&mdash;off the west Coast of South
America. With good wind McArliss planned to
sight the Islands off New Zealand in three weeks.
We had a week’s good sailing until yesterday&mdash;so
we are a fortnight, as the <i>Jade</i> reckoned, from&mdash;<i>your
home</i>.”</p>

<p>Bellair turned to the woman. She did not
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Do you suppose we struck coral?” Fleury
asked.</p>

<p>The subject seemed very hopeless. “I saw
the charts in McArliss’ cabin. No reefs were
charted according to our passage. We may have
been off our course. But I do not understand.
The mate took our bearings yesterday noon. I
do not know what he reported to the Captain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It may have been a sunken wreck that we
struck,” said Fleury.</p>

<p>Bellair had thought of that. He turned to
Stackhouse, who might have had something to
say, but the other stared at them balefully&mdash;at
their faces, not meeting their eyes. Either he had
not followed their words, or chose to take no
part.</p>

<p>“If we are in the course of any ships at all,
it would be of one passing our route, from the
Horn to the Islands,” Fleury added. “I doubt if
it would do us any good to row. We must not
tax our strength. If we are off our course, we
cannot tell whether it is to the north or south,
so nothing is positively to be gained. It’s a question
of hands up. The other boat set out for
somewhere at once. If they find ship they will
tell the story&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It appeared a useless recounting of obvious
things. Bellair had thought this out bit by bit
several times without finding the least substance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>to tie to. Fleury’s addition merely accentuated
the bleakness of their position.</p>

<p>“Still,” the preacher added, “if there is nothing
for us to do in the way of struggle&mdash;the rest is
simplified. We may be thoroughly tested, but I
feel a strange confidence of our ultimate delivery.
I thought of it before we had parted from the
<i>Jade</i>. It came to me again in the night. I believe
it now. We do not belong to the deep&mdash;not
all of us.”</p>

<p>Bellair wondered at the strength which came
from this. He placed his trust upon this man,
as one having familiarity with a source which he
personally did not draw from. The preacher’s
words were designed to cheer the woman, but he
could not let them pass as merely for that. Fleury
had a conviction, or he would not have spoken so.</p>

<p>The air grew cooler during the long closing of
that first day. Bellair thought of his overcoat
which lay in a roll under the narrow planking
forward where the woman sat. The bundle of
New York papers dropped out, as he drew the
garment forth. He opened one of the papers
laughingly.... The headlines were like voices
from another world. The abyss between the real
and the unreal yawned before his eyes now in
the open boat. New York seemed to be fighting
in prints for things so little and unavailing. So
little ago, he, Bellair, had moved among them,
as among things that counted. Now what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>real was the woman’s courage and the substance
of Fleury’s faith, and the hope that came from
the immensity. The deep contrasts of life held
Bellair.</p>

<p>As the message of the press came up to his
eyes, he sunk into queer apathy, believed himself
dreaming when he read his own name. He was
not startled; even that was not his, but an invention
like the clicking of a watch, which marks off
an illusion of the illusion time.... An afternoon
paper, dated the second day after his departure
from New York; a brief statement of his
departure with certain funds of Lot &amp; Company;
one item of a thousand dollars, several others
suspected missing.... There was a follow story
in the next day’s issue: Bellair as yet unfound,
was believed to have gone to the Cobalt; Bessie
Brealt, a professional singer, had passed an hour
or two with the missing man on the eve of his
flight. He had spent money recklessly.... This
was all.</p>

<p>He dumped the papers overside, and was sorry
afterward; still, there was not physical energy
in him to explain, nor comprehension in the other
two for such details. Lot &amp; Company had sacrificed
him to ward off disclosures he might make.
Possibly Attorney Jackson had suggested the step.
It was very clear. Even if the station-porter had
not mailed his letter, they would have found his
order of release in the safe. It was a part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>other world&mdash;proper business from Lot &amp; Company’s
point of view. He was marked a thief in
his small circle. He seemed to see the face of
the boarding-house woman as she heard the news.
She would search her house.... And Bessie
Brealt.... The tempter, notoriety, was responsible
for her small, mean part. It wasn’t an accident.
She must have looked at his card and told,
for the reporters would not have come to her....
It began to hurt him, mainly because of the
thoughts and dreams of helping her, which had
come to him since, especially here in the open
boat. She had fallen into one of the little tricks
of New York&mdash;to break into print at any cost.
There wasn’t much reality in the rest, nor much
chance of his needing New York again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... Three and a child in a small boat. The
pale moon-crescent, her bow to the sinking sun,
appeared higher in the west. What a cosmic
intervention&mdash;since last night when he had seen
her first arc and the earth-shine from the deck of
the <i>Jade</i>! And what a supper he had gone down
to afterward! There was wrench in that&mdash;an
age since then.... No one had spoken for a
long time. Bellair wondered if the man and
woman thought of food as he did.</p>

<p>Three and a child in the empty sea, and the
great suns of night were coming forth in the
deepening dusk. They were strangers, but more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>real than the sea. This was not like the earth
at all; and yet the <i>Jade</i> had been of the earth.
Her fabric had contained the bond that held from
port to port. Stars and sea&mdash;one more real than
the other, and different, too, for there was horror
in looking down, but hope in looking up. Something
in his breast answered the universality&mdash;but
quailed before the deep.</p>

<p>... Just now Bellair, lifting his overcoat to
draw it closer around him, sensed its unaccustomed
weight on the left. His hand sped thither,
touched the full bottle of Bourbon whiskey purchased
in Savannah. His hand remained with
it a moment. A shudder passed through the small
boat from Stackhouse, who had come to from
another hideous sleep.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair stared into the sea. No one had spoken
for many minutes. It was close to noon. Though
all that had to do with memory since the
sinking of the <i>Jade</i> was treacherous, according
to his recounting, it was but the second
day; that is, the mother-ship had gone down in
the heart of night before last.... Bellair had
given away to temptation, when he let his eyes
sink into the depths. He had fought it for hours,
and knew that nothing good would come of it,
but there was so much to fight, he had not the
further strength for this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The sea was calm on the surface, but there
appeared a movement below, so vast and unhurried,
that it was like some planetary function.
There seemed a draw of the depths southward,
an under-movement toward the Pole. At times
a cloud of purple would rise from far beneath and
shut off his peering, like the movement of blueing
in a laundry-tub before it is well-diffused. It
came to him that this was but a denser cloud-land&mdash;an
ocean of condensed clouds, moved not
by winds alone, but the stirring of the earth’s
mysterious inner attractions, which in their turn
were determined by the sun and moon and stars.
It was all orderly, but he, Bellair, was out of
order. And such a little thing&mdash;a quart of cool
water, and any one of the thousands of meals
he had thoughtlessly, gratelessly bought and paid
for&mdash;thousands consumed with a book at hand, or
a paper to keep his mind off the perfunctory routine
of feeding himself. Hundreds of meals he
had taken, because it was the hour, and a cigar
was more pleasurable afterward; meals in his
room&mdash;paper packages of food, pails of ice, chilled
bottles with a mist forming on them; saloon
lunches, plates of colored sausages, creamy-rose
slices of ham, tailored radishes and herring pickled
in onions.... There was not a fish in the sea,
not a movement but the blueing, and that slide
of the under-ocean river to the Pole.</p>

<p>Yet there <i>was</i> something in there&mdash;an end to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>this disorder. It would take all he had left&mdash;the
good air. It was like a knife or a gun or a poison-pill....
The movement below was so strong
that it would grip him, shut him from the air,
and leave him slithering along toward the Pole,
sometimes sinking sideways, and then rising, forever
seeking his balance ... not forever. He
pictured himself in a school of herring, thousands
of bright lidless eyes, thousands of bubbles, like
eyes, from their mouths opening and shutting&mdash;he
slithering sideways&mdash;his hands moving in the
tugs and pressures. They would cease to dart
from his movements, understanding them as the
ground-birds know the wind in the grass. Lips
and eye-lids and nostrils&mdash;they would have food.
Food was the great event of the day to all things&mdash;except
men. Men ate by the clock, ate to
smoke, ate to soften the hearts of women ...
yet after all food was food.... Or one big fish....
Or two fighting for him.... Or one finding
him lying still, a slow fanning of fins against
the purple pressures, watching to be sure&mdash;then
the strike.... Once he had examined a minnow
after the strike of a bass.... Where would <i>he</i>
be in that strike&mdash;or in that herring school-room&mdash;not
that slithering sideways thing&mdash;but <i>he</i>?
Would he be watching humorously, or back in
the cage with Mr. Sproxley, or in Bessie’s bedroom?
Was it all a myth about that other <i>he</i>?
It seemed a myth with his stomach sinking, tightening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
like a dripping rag between a pair of mighty
elbows. In the centre of the rag was a compressed
cork, and in the cork, a screw was twisting.</p>

<p>Cork&mdash;that made him think of the whiskey. He
turned from the water to the coat under the seat,
his eyes blinking. His bare foot moved painfully
to the coat and along the breast to the
pocket, to the hard hump of the bottle.</p>

<p>His eyes suddenly filled with the figure of
Stackhouse, whose attitudes were an endless series
of death tableaus, as his stories had also pictured.
His face had broken out into more beard, his eyes
glazed, body shapeless, like clothing stuffed with
hair. His hands held the primal significance of
birth and death. They lay upon his limbs, the
thumbs drawn into the palms, the first and little
fingers of each pointing straight down. Bellair
thought of how death contracts the thumb, and
how infants come with their thumbs in-drawn.</p>

<p>Also his mind was played upon by two distinct
series of emotions&mdash;Stackhouse representing
one set; Fleury and the Faraway Woman signifying
the other. He swung from power to power.
Then his concern and fascination for Stackhouse
changed from loathing and the visible tragedy, to
a queer passage of conjecture regarding the worldwide
processes which had nourished that huge body
to its fall. In fact, Bellair’s favourite restaurants
returned to mind like a pageant; the little inns
on the Sound that he used to go summer Saturday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>afternoons; the one place in Staten where there
were corn-cakes and a view of the shipping; the
myriad eating and drinking places of New York;
and from them all, one shop of chop and chicken-broils
where the miracles were done on wood-embers,
so that even the smoke that filled the
place was seasoned nutriment.</p>

<p>“They certainly knew how to buy,” he muttered
aloud.</p>

<p>It was a kind of moan, and he added quickly:
“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>Fleury and the woman regarded him with silent
kindness.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of a man I knew&mdash;a buyer
of canned goods,” he explained hastily. “The
bargains in canned-goods he had a way of pulling
off! There wasn’t a man in New York who could
bring in lines of stuff at the figure he copped&mdash;a
little runt of a man named Blath, who knew his
business&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fleury leaned back as if reaching for support,
his quiet smile not a little tender. His two
browned hands came forward to Bellair’s knees,
and he said with a devoted smile:</p>

<p>“I’ll not forget that in a hurry.... Blath,
you say his name was?”</p>

<p>Bellair knew well that he had not kept his
mental pictures from Fleury’s mind. His entire
consciousness had been in steam and woodsmoke
having to do with broiling meat. The three were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>worn thin, worn to fine receptivity, and caught
one-another’s thought without effort of many
words.... Though he did not turn, a shock of
pity came to him now for the master. He had
meant to save the opening of the whiskey for
the next dawn, vaguely thinking that if they
should find the sea empty once more, there would
be that false strength to fall back upon. Stackhouse
could not live more than a day or two
longer. He was torn by devils, his only surcease
being the snap of consciousness from time to time.
The whiskey had been upon Bellair’s mind like
a curse. He wanted its force for himself, but
never really meant to use it, had not even given
the temptation leeway. His lot was cast with
the forward forces; they would not have touched
the contents of his bottle. This did not change
the desire, however.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">4</p>

<p class="no-indent">The third day. Bellair was light-headed from
the scarcity of crackers. Yesterday had been
a mingled thirst and hunger day, but this was
characterised by hunger incessant. To-morrow he
anticipated with dread another thirst horror, and
after that, no hunger at all, but mighty agony
that knew but the one word, <i>Water</i>. The keen
airs of night and morning, and the sterilised burning
of the noons, constantly fanned and stimulated
the natural demands of the body.... He had
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>forgotten the newspapers. Bessie’s face came before
him&mdash;something of her deep heart-touching
tones which changed him.</p>

<p>“There must be a great woman there&mdash;a great
fine woman&mdash;like this one.”</p>

<p>He did not turn. It may have been the first
concession from his every-day faculties of this
woman’s actual beauty. He had already granted
this deeper within, where the understandings of
men are wiser, but harder to get at. Certain hours
had shown him the clear quality of saints and
martyrs; and he had seen in pure life-equation
that the child was worth his life or Fleury’s.
He would have given his, as most white men
would, but it was different to see the value and
rightness of it....</p>

<p>There was now an unspeakable need in the
stern. He drew the bottle from the overcoat-pocket
at his feet, without turning. Fleury and
the woman watched him. He cut the small wires
with his knife, tore off the wafer, half-expectant
of some sound from behind.... The day was
ending. The young moon newly visible in the
dusk began its curve into the west from a higher
point in the sky....</p>

<p>There was a screw in Bellair’s knife. It sank
noiselessly into the cork, but the first creak of the
stopper against the glass brought the jolt. They
all felt it&mdash;as if the great body had fallen from a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Stackhouse was staring at the thing in Bellair’s
hands, his tongue visible, his face filling
with light. He rubbed his eyes, the beginnings
of articulation deep in his throat. He was trying
to make himself believe it was not a vision. That
harrowed them. A pirate would have pitied him&mdash;reptile
desire imaged not in the face alone, but
in the hands and all. Bellair poured a big drink
in a tin-cup. Fleury passed him a gill of water.
Stackhouse drained the cup with a cry.</p>

<p>Something earth-bound slowly left his face.
In contrast it grew mild and reckonable; but within
an hour he was wild with pain, and dangerous
for night was falling. In the light of the moon
there was treachery. Bellair and Fleury sat together
in the centre. The other’s bulk was great
and the boat small. In becoming custodian of
a bottle of whiskey, Bellair now required help.
He wished it in the sea, but there was a pang of
cruelty about that. The new force that animated
Stackhouse had to be reckoned with. It was both
cunning and destructive. There was no murder
in their hearts.... Stackhouse drew his feet
under him, helping them with his hands; his eyeballs
turned upward from the agony of cramps
in his limbs; then he sank forward on his knees.
The craft of desire had turned from fighting to
speech. The moon was grey upon his breast
and gleamed from his eyes.</p>

<p>“You will listen to a man who is dying. Yes,
Bellair, you will listen&mdash;who listened to me so
much.... Give me drink, so I can talk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It may save you&mdash;but not if you take it all
at once.”</p>

<p>The creature winced, but his passion moved to
its appointed ends. He drew forth the large
brown wallet they had often seen; rubbed it in
his hands, until his fingers could feel; then opened
the leather band. From one receptacle he lifted
a thick package of bank-notes.</p>

<p>“I liked you, Bellair&mdash;almost as I liked one
Belding. I could have done much for you. I
hate <i>that</i> man, for he has made my death
hard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His face turned toward Fleury, but did not
meet the preacher’s eyes.</p>

<p>“The <i>Jade</i> brought a sweet cargo to Ameriga,
and Stackhouse does not bank in New York....
Bellair, I want to drink&mdash;so the talk will
come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>So absurd was the sound of cargo and banking
that Bellair thought his mind had wandered again,
yet he said:</p>

<p>“You are better. You cannot drink each hour.
If this is to help you, you must be sane.”</p>

<p>“I have something to say of imbortance&mdash;you
will help me, Bellair. It is for you.”</p>

<p>The faces of Fleury and the mother gave him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>no help. They were kind, but the thing seemed
beneath them, as if they were waiting for him
to come back from it.</p>

<p>“You have stood by that man, and not by me,”
Stackhouse said hoarsely. “So that I meant to
toss this in the sea at the last&mdash;this and all the
papers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He lifted the bank-notes and showed him the
collection of separately-banded documents.</p>

<p>“I am a rich man, and I have no heir. I had
thought of you, but you turned away from me
and did not continue to listen. You went to him
of the breachings&mdash;but you have now what is
needful for me and I will bay. I have no heir.
I said that before. I dell you now. A dying
man does not lie. There are papers to make you
rich, for I have other fortunes. Look, I will toss
it into the sea&mdash;if you do not give me that
bottle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair laughed at him.</p>

<p>“These are thousand dollar notes&mdash;there are
fifty of them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair turned aside for an instant. Money and
papers of more money&mdash;these were very far from
fanning excitement in his breast. A loaf and a
jug of fresh water were real; the moon’s higher
appearance each night, and the majestic plan of
the night-suns, these were real. Fleury, the
woman and the babe, lost in the brimming darkness
of earth’s ocean&mdash;they were real. Like the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>stars they had to do with the mighty Conceiver
of it all. They were a part of the Conception&mdash;and
so they were real&mdash;but the dollars of
men....</p>

<p>“And do you know what I will do&mdash;after I
have tossed this into the sea?”</p>

<p>The question brought him back quickly.</p>

<p>“No, Stackhouse,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I will come for you and dake that bottle. I
am big. I have strength. I will dake it&mdash;or you
will kill me&mdash;and that will be the end&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair thought of that. There was a pistol
in his coat. He did not want to use it. He believed
Stackhouse would do as he said.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Bellair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If I give it to you&mdash;oh, not for that rubbish!”
he pointed to the wallet. “If I give it to you&mdash;you
will die more quickly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is what I want.”</p>

<p>“But it is not our way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stackhouse tore loose from his shirtpocket the
heavy gold watch and its heavier chain, dropped
the whole into one of the folds of the wallet to
weight it down. “It will sink,” he said.</p>

<p>“To hell with it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Bellair!” Stackhouse moaned,
his arm rising with the wallet and falling again.</p>

<p>At that instant Bellair thought of Bessie Brealt
and her career.... He turned to Fleury and
the Mother. They were regarding him with kindest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
concern&mdash;as if he were a loved one who could
not fail to do well in any event. Then he thought
of the work that Fleury might do&mdash;the preacher
who had finished with talk, and was so eager to
act.... And just then, the little child turned
to him from the mother’s breast&mdash;a puzzled look,
but calm, and a flicker of the damp upper lip, as
if it would like to smile, but was not sure.</p>

<p>Bellair held out the whiskey. The wallet was
thrust in his hands for reception of the bottle&mdash;a
frenzied transaction.</p>

<p>They begged him to spare it for his own peace.
They gave him water, but poor Stackhouse could
not live with the stuff in his hands. In fifteen
minutes the bottle was drained, and then the
monster wept.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">5</p>

<p class="no-indent">The night roved on like a night in still mountains.
The young moon had sunk behind the
sea. Jupiter in meridian glory seemed trying
to bring his white fire to the dying red of Antares....
A dark night of stars now, since the upstart
moon had left the deeper purple. Most of
all, Bellair was fascinated by the great yellow
gleam of Canopus. It was a dry, pure dark&mdash;no
drip in that night&mdash;but a thirsty horror in the
saline lapping of the ocean against the planks.</p>

<p>Stackhouse was headless in the shadow, his piglike
breathing a part of all. Fleury, the mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>and the child slept; the preacher’s head close to
the knees of the woman. Bellair marked that, and
that Fleury loved her. At times the preacher’s
whole life seemed an effort to make her eat and
drink; and as for Fleury himself it often appeared
that he required no better nutriment than
that of conferring food and water upon the others.
As custodian, he claimed authority for his action....
Bellair thought long of Bessie. He was
watching the east at last for Venus to arise ahead
of the sun....</p>

<p>... But Bessie became blurred. He did not
understand. Either his brain had another picture,
or the original of the singing girl was fading....
A New York voice, no passion, but ambition,
an excellent voice&mdash;and such a beautiful,
girlish breast.... Bellair tried to shake this
coldness from him. This was not being true. He
had a faint suspicion that a man’s woman is more
apt to depart from him while he is at her side
than when he is away. It is because another has
come, if passion for the old dies, when one is
away. Alone and apart, man is more ardent, in
fact, unless a new picture composes.... He
thought of Davy Acton, the office boy at Lot &amp;
Company’s, that wistful, sincere face&mdash;and then
Bellair gave way to the night.</p>

<p>This was a new sensation. It came from the
hunger and thirst. He could <i>let go</i>. The purple
immensity would then take him. A half-hour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>even an hour, would pass. It was not sleep, very
different from that. He was not altogether lost.
A little drum-beat would come back to him from
the mighty revery-space, and his heart would answer
the beat. He seemed to be on the borderland
of the Ultimate Secret; and invariably afterward
he was amazed at what he had been&mdash;so sordid
and sunken and depraved was the recent life he
had known.</p>

<p>“But I was what the days and years seemed to
want of me,” he muttered.</p>

<p>That was the gall of it. Days and years are
betrayers; all the activities of the world are betrayers.
He glimpsed the great patience of the
scheme. Only man makes haste. Myriad pressures,
subtle and still-voiced, tighten upon a man,
bringing just the suggestion that all is not well
with him. Then there are the more obvious pressures&mdash;fever,
desire, the death of a man’s loves&mdash;to
make him stop and look and listen. But so
seldom does he relate these to the restlessness of
his soul. Rather he attributes them to the general
misery of life. He has been taught to do so&mdash;the
false teaching.... For general misery is not
the plan of life. If <i>children</i> could only be taught
that it is all superbly balanced, the plan perfect;
that not a momentary stress of suffering comes
undeserved; that the burden of all suffering is
to make a man change!... A sentence came so
clearly to him that even his lips formed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“The plan of life is for joy!”</p>

<p>He saw the need of every hundredth man at
least, arising to repeat this sentence around the
world&mdash;arising from his pain and husks like the
Younger Son, and returning to the joy of the
Father’s House.... Something was singing in
him from his thought of <i>children</i>.</p>

<p>“We’re too old,” he thought, meaning the millions
of men caught in the world as he had been,
“but the children could learn. They could
change&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had turned to the bow. Fleury was a
nearer shadow, sitting, head bowed forward. The
Mother’s head lay back against Bellair’s coat, the
child across her knees.... That faint grey light
was about her. He had not noted this at first;
it seemed to have come from the moment of contemplation&mdash;something
like starlight, something
like the earth-shine that Fleury explained. Her
lips were parted, and her eyes seemed held shut,
not as if she slept but as if she were thinking of
something dear to her&mdash;her face wasted a little.</p>

<p>He saw it more clearly than the faintness of
the light would suggest&mdash;and to Bellair’s breast
came a sudden sense of her expectancy. It seemed
she were awake, but lying back with eyes shut
awaiting a lover, her face wasted a little from
the burning of expectation. For a moment it was
very beautiful to him. Then all was spoiled&mdash;for
the personal entered. Almost before he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>any volition in the matter, his mind had flashed
across the interval of space between them&mdash;as if
he were the one to bring that token to the parted
lips.</p>

<p>He shook his head with impatience, and the
miseries of the hour rushed home to his mind.</p>

<p>... Fleury was awake and they were whispering,
the woman still asleep.</p>

<p>“The plan of the world is for joy,” Bellair
said wearily. “We are all taught that it is a
vale of tears&mdash;that’s the trouble&mdash;taught that we
must grab what we can.”</p>

<p>“If we won’t learn from joy&mdash;we’ve got to
take the pain,” said the preacher. “We’ve got
to get out of the conception of time and space as
the world sees it to catch a glimpse of the joy
of the plan. We are in the midst of a superb
puzzle. To those who see only the matter and
not the meaning, life is an evil country, a country
of dragons and monsters. But there’s a soul to
it all, and man has a soul. If a man begins to
use his soul to see and think with, the puzzle begins
to unfold. A man’s soul isn’t of matter. It’s
a pilgrim come far, far to go&mdash;very eager
to get this particular journey through matter
ended&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But why make the journey?”</p>

<p>“To learn evil.”</p>

<p>“The Younger Son wasted himself afield&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Was he not placed afterward above the elder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>in the Father’s heart?” Fleury asked. “Could he
not appreciate the Father’s House better than him
who had not left it? Man is greater than angels&mdash;that’s
hinted at everywhere in the Scriptures.
Angels are unalloyed good. The man who has
mastered matter becomes a creative force. All the
great stories of the world tell the same story&mdash;the
wanderings of Ulysses, the tasks of Hercules. The
soul’s mastery of each task and escape from each
peril and illusion is an added lesson&mdash;finally the
puzzle breaks open. The adventurer sees the long
journey of the soul, not this little earth-crossing.
He sees that his misery now is but a dip of the
valley&mdash;that the long way is a steadily rising
road&mdash;that the plan <i>is</i> for joy.”</p>

<p>It came home to him closer than ever before
that night. His soul had tried to express itself
and ordain his higher ways these many years, but
he had lost his way in the world. He perceived
that all men lose their way; that he had suddenly
been shaken apart so he could see. It was luck
in his case&mdash;the misery at Lot &amp; Company’s, the
singing of Bessie Brealt, the unparalleled contrasts
here in the open boat. But why should he be
shown, and not the millions of other imprisoned
men? Was this a part of the great patience of
the scheme again? Would something happen to
each man in due season, some force in good time
to help him to rise and be free?</p>

<p>“The man who ties himself to the pilgrim&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
not the sick little chattering world creature&mdash;suddenly
finds that he has but one job,” Fleury
said presently. “He’s got to tell about it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The world suddenly smote Bellair.</p>

<p>“Why, men would say a man was crazy if he
told the things we have thought this night,” he
said, leaning forward. “Maybe we are a bit unsound.
Perhaps these are illusions we are harbouring&mdash;vagaries
from drying up and wasting
away, similar to the vagaries of alcohol&mdash;doubtless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was like waking from a dream&mdash;the horrible
sounds now from the stern. Bellair heard Fleury’s
voice. Turning, he saw Venus before anything
else. It was the thought that he had fallen into
the revery with, and had to be finished on the
way out.</p>

<p>Under that superb vision of morning, Stackhouse
was kneeling, his breast against the rail,&mdash;bringing
up to his mouth great palm-fuls of
brine.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">6</p>

<p class="no-indent">The things that happened in the open boat
on this fourth day are not altogether to be explained.
A metaphysician from the East explained
a similar visitation&mdash;but like many
explanations of the East, the foundations of his
discussion were off the ground. He did not begin
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>with stuff that weighs-up avoirdupois. The West
can weigh the moon and estimate the bulk of
Antares’ occulted companion, but in cases where
<i>things</i> cease to be weighable, our side of the world
sits back with the remark, “It is well enough to
hypothecate the immaterial, but what’s the good
of it when you can’t see it?” Also when the East
gently suggests an opinion, the West rises to declare,
“Why, you people haven’t got gas or running
water in your houses.”</p>

<p>Now occasionally there comes a time when the
Western eye sees something that it can’t touch
or smell exactly, and it is easier to disbelieve its
own senses than to change its point of view for
an Eastern one. Accordingly it says, “I was
crazy with the heat,” or as Bellair was prone to
explain away the visitation of this day, “The
thirst and the hunger had got to me.”</p>

<p>There follows, without further peroration, an
unheated narrative of what <i>appeared</i> to take place
on that fourth day:</p>

<p>As was expected from drinking the brine, Stackhouse
went mad. The look of the great creature,
his very identity, changed, went out from him,
and something else came in. This happens when a
dog goes mad. We have had to reckon with it
in our own families. If that which we knew
passes, without something foreign taking its place,
the result would be a mere inert mass waiting
for death. The alienists have given us the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span><i>obsession</i> to explain that which comes instead,
making an obscenity and violence of that which
we knew. In the olden days these Enterers were
known as demons. A man named Legion was
beset with them, and Another with a strong will
came and, according to the story, freed Legion.
That which had defiled him entered a herd of
swine, the bars of which were somehow down at
the time....</p>

<p>They had ceased to hate Stackhouse. The old
Master was gone into who knows what long feeding
dream? This was merely his body that they
watched for an hour or two in the forenoon. In
fact, Bellair had studied the departure with some
detachment. He was sitting as usual in the centre
of the boat, glad that the Stackhouse agony was
done. There was a moment in which it appeared
that death was stealing in rapidly, and another
in which a new kind of life entered the body&mdash;as
vandals enter to despoil a house after the tenant
has moved away.</p>

<p>The hunched body had suddenly reached for
him like a great ape. Bellair had felt the crippling
force of the touch, and an almost equal
force from the thought that flashed in his mind&mdash;to
use the pistol.... The boat had rocked beneath
them. The blackness of much blood was
in Bellair’s brain. The struggle was brief.
Through it all, Bellair heard the cries of the child.
Just as he was ready to fail, the monster sat back,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>his teeth snapping in his beard&mdash;the huge hands
feeling for him, as one blinded.</p>

<p>“Change places with me, Bellair.”</p>

<p>This was from Fleury&mdash;midforenoon that
fourth day. Bellair obeyed because he was afraid
of the pistol at hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to kill him,” he panted.</p>

<p>“It will not come to that,” Fleury answered.</p>

<p>It was then that the transfer of seats was made.
Bellair relied vaguely upon the preacher’s greater
strength which was not of limb and shoulder.
The monster dropped to his knees to renew the
fight.</p>

<p>“Be still,” Fleury commanded. “Be still and
rest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stackhouse himself would not have faltered before
that voice of Fleury’s, but there was a force
in it that prevailed for a moment upon the obsession.
The air was full of strain.... They
heard the heart in the poor body. The blue-tipped
hands were upraised from the bottom of the boat&mdash;the
face was toward them. Bellair and the
Faraway Woman could see only the back of
Fleury’s head. The strain was like a vice in the
open boat.</p>

<p>Bellair contemplated the mystery: that this
force, lower and more destructive than Stackhouse,
could be managed and subdued in part by the
energy of another’s will-power, when Stackhouse
himself would have required brute strength....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
He thought he understood what was going
on, though he would likely have scouted the same
had some one told him. In any event, Fleury
was quieting the complicated thing before him....
They heard the heart-beats rise and sink,
the hands often lifting from the bottom. The
entire passage of the battle was magnified before
their eyes. Hours passed. Fleury scarcely
turned.</p>

<p>So far there is nothing to call in the Eastern
metaphysicians, but the day was not done, nor
the dying galvanism of the monster. The afternoon
was still bright, when the great hairy head
cocked itself up differently&mdash;the eyes stretching
open and suddenly filled with yellow-green light,
the colour of squash-pulp close to the rind, but a
transparent light, that gathered the rays of the
day in its expiring lucency, and held their own
eyes&mdash;a lidless horror lifted from its belly. The
woman must have seen the change at the same
instant, for her cry blended with the voice of
Bellair. As one, they understood that this was
a different force for Fleury to meet&mdash;a wiser, more
ancient and terrific force, from the bowels of the
world of evil possibly, without relation to Stackhouse,
but with a very thrilling relation to them.</p>

<p>The whole face had a different look. It was
rising higher. The hands were braced upon the
grating, pushing the body up. They were accustomed
to the loosed havoc of bestiality which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>Stackhouse had left upon his features&mdash;but this
that looked out from his eyes was knit and intent.</p>

<p>Fleury’s hand groped back.</p>

<p>“It will not answer me,” he was saying. “This
is different. It will not obey me. Take my hand,
Bellair.... Yes, and take hers with the other.
We must drive it out.”</p>

<p>Weariness more than death was in the speech.
He had struggled for hours. It was the voice of
a man who had fought to his soul’s end. Bellair
held his hand and the woman’s, but felt himself
the betrayer. This had come <i>for him</i>! He was
the prophet lying still while the sailors deliberated.
They must cast him into the sea, before
this thing could be willed into quiescence. Concentration
on his part was broken by this conviction.</p>

<p>The body of Stackhouse was lifted to its knees&mdash;the
different face looking out of the eyes. They
sat before it like terrified children; the eyes found
them one after another, steadily, with unearthly
frigid humour, like some creative force of evil,
integrated of the ages, charged with intrepid will,
a ruling visitant that would tarry but an instant
for the climax.</p>

<p>It was not human, save in the shape and feature
for their recognition; its difference from the
human was its frank knowing destructiveness.
Humanity is mainly unconscious of the processes
of evil; <i>this had chosen</i>. This was of the pull
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>of the earth, and knew its power. It seemed
known to Bellair as if from some ancient meeting.
He could never have remembered, however,
without this return. It was devoid of sex,
which seemed to bring to him some old deep
problem that took its place with his ineffable
fear of the presence.</p>

<p>So Bellair sat between them, holding their
hands, but powerless to help.... It was higher,
looking out of the eyes of the body, in strange solution
with the fallen humanity of the face they
knew. And Bellair knew <i>he</i> was responsible.</p>

<p>“You must depart. You do not belong here,”
a voice said. Bellair could not tell if it were
Fleury’s or the woman’s or his own. It may have
been merely a thought.</p>

<p>The thing had uprisen now. It lurched in the
sway of the boat. Fleury and he were standing
to meet the body that hurled itself forward....
Water dashed over them. They were beneath the
monster. Bellair felt more than the crush of the
weight of flesh, a force kindred to electricity, but
not electric, a smothering defiling dynamics, that
despoiled him by the low, cold depth of its vibration,
rather than by the fierce fury of it. Then
he thought of the woman’s child. It came to him
like a pure gleam. The child must live. The
thought was very real, out of the self, but not <i>for</i>
self.... It seemed that he heard the heart of
Stackhouse break, and the demon hiss away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>Bellair looked up from the bottom of the boat.
The woman’s face was very close, his face between
her hands.</p>

<p>“... Yes, come back to us!” she was saying.
“Oh, we could not live without you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It did not seem real to him for a moment. He
turned from her merciful eyes. Fleury was sitting
there in the centre, holding the child with
hands that trembled. The boat rode lightly,
though water lay in the bottom. He turned farther.
Yes, the seat in the stern was empty.</p>

<p>“He is dead?” Bellair whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>“And we did not kill him,” Fleury added.</p>

<p>“But how did he get overside?”</p>

<p>“You helped,” they told him.</p>

<p>He did not remember. “And the child?”</p>

<p>“The little Gleam is all right. All is well with
us, Bellair.”</p>

<p>Something of the encounter returned now. “I
do not belong here with you,” he said. “The
thing&mdash;at the last&mdash;came for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then he realised how absurd this would sound&mdash;as
if some ogre had come. Yet they understood.</p>

<p>“I thought it had come for me,” the woman answered
quietly. “I said that, and <i>he</i>&mdash;&mdash;”she
turned with a smile to the preacher,“&mdash;and he
said the same&mdash;that it had come for him. We
will forget that. Something freed us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p>Bellair turned to the child.</p>

<p>“It was the little Gleam who freed us,” Fleury
said.</p>

<p>“How did you get that name?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“You said it.”</p>

<p>“How long have I been lying here?”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes.”</p>

<p>He rested a moment longer.... The woman
was sane, the child unhurt. Stackhouse was dead,
and they had not murdered him. It was the
fourth sunset.... Bellair sat up and turned his
eyes to the sea.</p>

<p>The great body was near. It would not sink.
They tried to row, but were too weak to pull
far. The calm sea would not cover it from their
eyes.... Even the birds did not come to it,
and there was no tugging from the deep.</p>

<p>The terrible battle of the day had left them
whimpering&mdash;drained men, in the pervading calm
of the sea, under the dry cloudless heat and light
of the sky. Fleury and Bellair looked at each
other and their eyes said: “We did not murder
him.” They looked again and found the woman
saner than they. They turned over her shoulder
to the blotch upon the sea. It floated high, drifted
with them. They could not speak connectedly,
but longed for the night.... At last, they heard
her voice:</p>

<p>“It is very great to me to know that there are
such men in the world. As a little girl in New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>Zealand I used to picture such heroes&mdash;such brothers
and heroes. I came to doubt it afterward, and
that was evil in me. I see now that the dream
was true&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They listened like two little boys.</p>

<p>“See, the cool is coming!” she added. “The
child is glad, too. To-night, we will talk!”</p>

<p>“You will tell us a story?” Fleury said.</p>

<p>“Yes, when it is darker. It is all so safe and
quiet now. We are all one.”</p>

<p>That meant something to Bellair. Later when
it was dark, and they had supped, he said:</p>

<p>“It’s good&mdash;the way you count me in, but you
shouldn’t. I don’t belong, much as I’d like to. I
misjudged you at first. I misjudged Fleury&mdash;and
him&mdash;&mdash;” he pointed over her shoulder to
the sea.</p>

<p>“It will be gone in the morning,” she whispered,
patting his hand. “We are three&mdash;and the
child.”</p>

<p>“Three, and God bless you,” said Fleury.
“Three and the little Gleam&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Gleam,” the woman repeated, holding the
child closer. “I love that.”</p>

<p>“We are three and we follow the Gleam.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">7</p>

<p class="no-indent">Fleury took the child. The Faraway Woman sat
straight in her seat, so that Bellair wondered at her
strength. Her strength came to him. The deeps
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_1482">[Pg 148]</span>of his listening were opened to her low voice. The
story came to them with all the colour and contour
of her thought-pictures&mdash;a richness from the unspoken
words which cannot be given again:</p>

<p>“It’s about a little girl whom I will call Olga,”
she said. “That is really her name, and the story
is the little girl’s truly. I shall only tell part of
it to-night, for it is long and I would only tell you
the happy part&mdash;to-night.</p>

<p>“Olga’s father and mother and the other children
lived in a low house by the open road that
led to Hamilton. He raised sheep for a living
on the rolling pasture-lands near the Waikata
river, a hundred miles south of Auckland....
Yes, Olga was born in New Zealand&mdash;the youngest
of a houseful of sisters. They belong more
to the latter part of the story which I shall not
tell to-night&mdash;just the happy part to-night....
The first thing that Olga remembered as belonging
to the Great Subject was spoken by her father
one evening when they were all together at their
supper of bread and milk:</p>

<p>“‘... One never knows. It is best not to
turn away any stranger, not even if he is shabby
and ill-looking. I heard of a house where a
stranger was turned away. They were not bad
people, but supper was over, the things put aside,
and the woman was very tired. The stranger was
taken in at the next house, and in the morning
he seemed different to them&mdash;not shabby or ill-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
at all, but rested and laughing, with
bright lights about his hair. Always afterward,
that house was blest, but the other house went on
in its misery and labour. One never knows. It
is best not to turn any stranger away.’</p>

<p>“Now Olga understood that from beginning to
end. Many times before she had tried to follow
the talk at the table, but the words would come
too fast, and she would fall away to her own manner
of seeing things. This talk simplified many
matters for her, and seemed greatly to be approved.
So in the evenings she began to watch
for <i>her</i> guest up the long level road that led to
Hamilton. All that summer Olga thought of it
and watched, though she was very little and only
five. Sometimes when it was not yet dark she
would venture forth a few steps and stare up the
long road, until the house of their distant but
nearest neighbour was all blurred in the night.
Just behind her cottage in the other direction, the
road dipped into a ravine, and the trees grew up
from it, shutting off the distance. No place could
be more wonderful than the ravine at midday, for
the shades were quickened with birds, bees, flowers
and much beside that only Olga saw, but its
enchantment was too keen for the evening, and
the night came there very quickly.</p>

<p>“Her Guest would never come from the ravineway,
but from the long, open road&mdash;Olga was
sure of this. Yet when stopping to think, she became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
afraid he would not be allowed to pass the
neighbour’s house. Their little Paul was her frequent
playmate, and Paul’s father and mother
were most good and hospitable people, the last on
the Hamilton road to let a stranger go by, without
food and shelter. And Paul would be looking,
for he was almost always interested in her
things.... But perhaps they would be in at
supper and not see the stranger; or perhaps he
would not want to stop there, but would know
that <i>she</i> was watching. She made very certain
that he would not get by her house unobserved.</p>

<p>“Spring had come again. The pale blue hepaticas
were peeping into bloom. There was one
day that ended in Olga’s most wonderful night.
The sun had gone down, but not the light. The
sky was crowded with rich gold like the breast of
the purple martin&mdash;flickerings of beautiful light
in the air, as if little balls of happiness were bursting
of themselves. The shadows were soft on the
long road; the tiles of the neighbour’s low house
were like beaten gold, and the perfume of the
hyacinths flooded everywhere into the silence. All
that heaven could ever be was in that broad splendour
and sweetness&mdash;the ravine a soft purple stillness
behind, and a faint mist of red falling in the
distant gold.</p>

<p>“He was coming. She knew him for The Guest
from afar. The neighbours’ house was already
dimmed, but the stranger was clear, so that she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>knew he had passed their door. She ran forth
to meet him, and no one called to her from behind.
It seemed all made for her&mdash;the evening
so sweet and vast and perfect. One of her little
loose shoes came off as she hurried, but she did
not stop. The single one made her running
clumsy, so she kicked that free too. He must not
think she was a little lame girl.... He was farther
than she thought; she had never come so far
alone in the evening. And yet how clearly she
could see him....</p>

<p>“He must be very tired, for sometimes he was
on one side of the road, and sometimes on the
other. He was quite old, and his step unsteady,
yet he carried his cane and did not use it....
His head was uncovered. Now she knew why his
steps were so unsteady. He was looking upward
as he walked&mdash;upward and around quite joyously,
the glow of the sky upon his white beard and hair&mdash;so
that he did not see her coming, and her bare
feet were silent on the road.</p>

<p>“She felt very little as she touched his cane.</p>

<p>“‘Won’t you come to our house to rest? Oh,
please&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes,’ he answered, but did not look
down.</p>

<p>“‘Our house is near&mdash;won’t you come?’ she
asked again, and turning, she was surprised how
far it was, but not afraid, and no one called to
her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>
<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ he answered.</p>

<p>“‘But I am down here&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Bless me&mdash;are you?’</p>

<p>“He did not seem to see her very well, but tried
to follow her voice, his eyes looking past her, and
to the side, his great hands groping for her gently.
Olga spoke again and touched his hands. Then
he really saw her, and she sighed with relief, because
his eyes filled with the gentlest love she had
ever seen&mdash;seemed to rest upon her and enclose her
at the same time. The gladdest smile of welcome
had come to his face. Both her hands were in
his groping ones, but now she turned and led him.
There was silence as they walked, and Olga asked:</p>

<p>“‘But what were you looking for&mdash;you were
looking up, you know?’</p>

<p>“‘Was I, dear?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, and what were you looking for?’</p>

<p>“‘I was looking for my mother,’ he said.</p>

<p>“Olga thought how old she must be, and she
wanted to cry.... <i>Her</i> mother made the
stranger very welcome, and her father stood back
against the wall smiling in a way that she always
remembered, and without lighting his pipe until
after the stranger had finished his meal. There
was golden butter and the dark bread that is the
life of the peasants, a pitcher of fresh milk and
a bite of that cheese which is brought forth only
on Sundays or holidays. They pressed him to eat
more, saying that he must be in need of food after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>his journey, but it was very little that he really
took. He smiled and looked with peace from
face to face, but Olga had pulled her stool back
into the shadows, for she did not wish to intrude.
He had not seen so much of the others.</p>

<p>“A chair was brought to the hearth, for it was
now dark and there was a little fire burning against
the damp coolness of evening. They waited in
vain for him to speak. It was as if he had come
home. To Olga he was intensely memorable sitting
there in the firelight. The others would draw
near, and he leaned forward and looked into their
faces smilingly, but it was not the same....
Now he was looking and looking around the room.
He found her, and held out his hands. She heard
her mother say, ‘This is Olga’s guest.’</p>

<p>“She had not believed his old arms could be
so strong. With one hand he held her, while
the other patted her shoulder softly, slowly,&mdash;as
if he had everything he desired. All about her
was the firelight and the strange joyous whiteness
of him&mdash;his throat and collar and beard all lustrous
white. In his arms there was something she
had never known, even from her mother&mdash;a deep
and limitless joy, as if the world were all good,
and nothing could possibly happen that would
not be the right good thing.</p>

<p>“Then she became afraid her breast would
burst, for the happiness was more and more. It
had to do with the future, such a far distance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>seeing, all rising and increasingly good&mdash;until
Olga had to slip down from his knees, because the
happiness in and through her was more than she
could bear.</p>

<p>“‘I will come back,’ she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Outdoors she waited until the stars had
steadied and were like the stars she knew, for they
had been huge and blazing at first; then she returned
and he stretched out his hands to her, and
she heard her mother say, ‘Surely, this is Olga’s
guest.’</p>

<p>“She did not remember how she got into her
little bed. She heard the birds in the vines, and
it was golden day when she awoke. Suddenly
she knew that she had slept too long, that she
would find him gone.... She thought of her
little brown shoes on the road, but some one must
have brought them in, for there they were by the
bed.... He was no longer in the house, but she
did not weep. There had been so much of wonder
and beauty. She looked into her mother’s
face, but did not ask. The mother smiled, as if
waiting for her to speak. The other children must
have been told, for they did not speak.</p>

<p>“A thousand times Olga wished that she had
awakened in time; often it came to her that she
had not done all she could for her guest, but
there was never real misery about it, and she was
never quite the same after that perfect night. She
thought it out bit by bit every day, but it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>long, long afterward before she spoke, and this
was to an elder sister, who&mdash;it was most strange
and pitiful to Olga&mdash;seemed to have forgotten
it all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Faraway Woman reached for the child,
and held it close and strangely. Fleury offered
her water, but she took just a sup and bade them
finish the cup. “That was the happy part,” she
added in a whisper, her back moving slowly to
and fro, as she held the child high. “It might all
have been happier, but Olga was not quite like
the others. They did not tell her what they knew,
and Olga never could tell them what she felt.
Another time&mdash;some happy time&mdash;I will tell you,
who are so good&mdash;you will understand the rest of
the story&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Would you tell us if Olga’s guest came
again?” the preacher asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, he came again,” she said softly.</p>

<p>Bellair sat still for several moments. Then he
leaned forward and touched the child’s dress.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">8</p>

<p class="no-indent">They made an appearance of drinking (with
a cracker in hand) at midnight, but it was
for the sake of the woman&mdash;a sup of tepid water.
The long night sailed by. Slowly the moon sank&mdash;that
dry moon, brick-red and bulbous, as it
entered the western sea. All was still in the little
boat. Bellair was ready to meet his suffering.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>He could not sleep&mdash;because the woman was
near. That was the night that her quality fixed
itself for all time exemplary in his heart.</p>

<p>The little story had revealed to him a new
sanctuary. He loved it and the little Gleam; as
for that, he loved Fleury, too. It was a strange
resolving of all separateness that had come to him
from these friends. More than ever thrilling it
had come, with Stackhouse out of the boat and
since the story had been made his.</p>

<p>She had been frightened by his loss of consciousness
at the end of the battle. He had awakened
looking into her eyes. He scarcely dared to
recall what she had said in her anxiety, but it
was an extraordinary matter of value. What
a mother she was; and what a little girl lived in
that story, and now!... That little girl was
still in her heart. The recent days in the open
boat had not spoiled her; nor the recent years of
loneliness and tragedy. Out of it all had come certain
perfect works&mdash;the babe in her arms, her own
fortitude and fearlessness of death; the little girl
still in her eyes and heart. Bellair saw that a man
loves the child in a woman, quite as much as a
woman loves the boy in a man.... She had said
that Fleury and he were brothers and heroes. He
knew better in his own case. Still she had said
it, adding that the discovery of such men to her
was a part of the very bloom of life....</p>

<p>Bellair was not thinking the personal relation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>now. Fleury and she were mated in his own
thoughts. From the beginning, this was so; and
yet he did not ask more. He had come to believe
from their glorious humanity (so strange to him
and unpromising in the beginning)&mdash;that the
world was crowded with latent values which, once
touched and quickened into life, would make it
a paradise.</p>

<p>That was the substance of the whole matter.
He must never forget it. The human values
which he had met in these were secret in thousands,
perhaps in millions, of hearts, and needed
only breaking open by stress and revelation&mdash;to
bring the millennium to old Mother Earth, and
open her skies for the plan of joy. Bellair impressed
this upon his mind again, so he would
not forget&mdash;then fell asleep.</p>

<p>She was first awake in the distance-clearing
light. She arose carefully, so as not to awaken
the men and the child, and stared long in every
quarter. There was no ship, no land, no cloud;
and yet a trace of happiness on her thin face, as
she sat down. Fleury was rousing. She had expected
that; for through their strange sympathy
several times before he had awakened with her,
or soon after. She bent forward and whispered
a good-morning, and added:</p>

<p>“It is gone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Surely?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Thank God.”</p>

<p>The preacher breathed deeply, contemplated
their faces one after another. From Bellair lying
in the stern, his eyes turned significantly to the
woman’s, and his own lit with zeal.... Bellair
was on the borderland then, coming up through
the fathoms of dream. Already he felt the heat;
the sun had imparted its ache to his eyes. The
three were half-blinded by the long brilliance of
the cloudless days on the sea.... Bellair was
trying to speak, but could not because of the parch
in his throat. Moreover, no thoughts could hold
him&mdash;not even Bessie. She came to mind, pink
and ineffectual, lost in her childish things. She
had failed this way before....</p>

<p>There was a cup to his lips. He smelled the
water, and wanted it as he wanted decency and
truth&mdash;as he wanted to be brave and fit to be one
of the three. It almost crazed him, the way he
wanted it&mdash;but it would be taking it from her.
All the violence of one-pointed will was against
the cup. He pushed it away.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Bellair,” said Fleury. “You’ll spill it.
Drink&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I won’t. Take it away.”</p>

<p>“You must drink. It is yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he must drink,” said the woman.</p>

<p>Bellair sat up. Fleury was holding the cup to
his lips.</p>

<p>“It is gone from behind,” said the preacher.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>“Drink your water. I have. I will speak to you
after you drink.”</p>

<p>He stared at them, and at the open sea behind
her. Then it came to him, as if from Fleury’s
mind, to obey.... Fleury then served the
woman. They ate a cracker together; at least it
seemed so. Then Fleury spoke:</p>

<p>“We have the child to serve&mdash;that is our first
thought; therefore we must think of the child’s
mother first. As for her other part, as our companion,
she will be one with us, of course. We
have been here five full days, and we have not
been allowed, by the presence of him who is gone&mdash;and
may God rest and keep that&mdash;we have not
been allowed to do the best we could in this great
privilege of being together and drawing close to
reality. Many have gone without food and drink
for ten days&mdash;to come close to God. There is
food here and water&mdash;to keep us in life. This is
what I would say: We must change our point
of view.”</p>

<p>He paused, and their eyes turned from one to
another. The child’s face seemed washed in the
magic of morning. The preacher added:</p>

<p>“We must cease to regard ourselves as suffering,
as creatures in want, as starving or dying of
thirst. Rather, as three souls knit, each to the
other, who have entered upon a pilgrimage together&mdash;a
period of simple austerity to cleanse and
purify our bodies the better to meet and sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>reality, and to approach with a finer sensitiveness,
than we have ever known&mdash;the mystery and ministry
of God.... So we are not suffering, Bellair.
We are not suffering&mdash;”</p>

<p>He turned to the woman.</p>

<p>“We are chosen ones. This is our wilderness.
When we are ready&mdash;God will speak to us. We
are very far from the poor needs of the body&mdash;for
this is the time and period of our consecration.
God bless you both&mdash;and the Gleam.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">9</p>

<p class="no-indent">It was the seventh evening, the cool coming in.
Bellair could not feel his body below his
lungs, unless he stopped to think. The child
was on his knee, his hands holding it. The little
face was browned, but very clear and bright. Bellair’s
hands against the child’s dress were clawlike
to his own eyes, like the hands of a black
man very aged. He could move his fingers when
he thought of it, but he did not know if they
moved unless he watched. The effort of steadying
the child he did not feel in his arms, but in his
shoulders. It was like the ache in his eyes. No
tears would come, but all the smart of tears’ beginnings;
and the least little thing would bring
it about. He had to stop between words and
wait for his throat to subside&mdash;in the simplest
saying.</p>

<p>He saw everything clearly. The open boat was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>like a seat lifted a trifle above the runways of
the world. He could see them, as one in the
swarming paths beneath could never hope to see.
It was all good, but the pain and the pressure
of them all!... Bessie Brealt in pain and pressure;
Davy Acton in the hard heavy air; Broadwell
who was trying to be a man at Lot &amp; Company’s;
the old boarding-house woman who had
forgotten everything but her rooms&mdash;her rooms
moving with shadows whom she never saw clearly
and never hoped to understand&mdash;shadows that
flitted, her accounts never in order, her rooms
never in order.... There had been people in
there whom he never saw&mdash;one girlish voice that
awakened in the afternoon and sang softly, a
most subdued and impossible singing. She worked
nights at a telephone switch-board&mdash;the night-desires
of the great city passing through her&mdash;and
she sang to the light of noon when it came to the
cage.... Sunday afternoons when it was fine,
a bearded man emerged from a back-room,
emerged with a cane and cigarette case. Always
on the front steps he lit the cigarette....</p>

<p>Bellair now couldn’t smoke.... Once there
had been moaning in a lower back room, moaning
night and morning from a woman. He was
not sure if it were the millinery woman, or the
one who worked in Kratz’s. The moaning stopped
and as he passed through the hall, he heard a
doctor say to the landlady:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“King Alcohol.”</p>

<p>Just that.... He saw the millinery woman
afterward, so it wasn’t she.... The air in the
old halls was of a character all its own. It was
stronger than the emanations from any of the
rooms. The separate currents lost their identity
like streams in the ocean, like souls in Brahma....
How strangely apart he had kept all that
five years! A face not seen before in the halls,
and he did not know if it were a newcomer or
old. So few came to the board to dine&mdash;the
chorus-woman from the Hippodrome, who came
up nightly from the water.... He saw the view
from his window&mdash;over the roofs and areas. It
was a wall of windows&mdash;dwellers in the canyon
sides; boxes of food hanging out, clothing out to
freshen itself in the dingy and sluggish airs&mdash;the
coloured stockings and the faces that looked out.
Everything was monotonous but the faces&mdash;faces
grim and sharp&mdash;faces of kittens and bulls and
rabbits and foxes, faces of ferrets, sleek faces, torn
faces, red and brutal, white and wasted faces;
faces of food and drink, faces of hunger and fear;
the drugged look; few tears but much dry yearning,
and not a face of joy.</p>

<p>There was no joyousness and peace in the lower
runways, but pain and heavy pressures.... Bellair
saw himself moving among those halls again,
not a stranger, but with a hand, a smile, a dollar.
No one would moan for days without his knowing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>He would find day-work for the little telephone
miss, and send orders for hats to the milliner. He
would awaken that shadow of all the shadows, the
landlady, with kindness and healing. He would
call across the windowed cavern.... They
would say, “Come over and help us,” and he would
rush down stairs, and around into other streets, and
faces there would be ready to show him. He saw
it all clearly, such as it was, but no facts. They
would not call to him. They would not be
healed. They would take a dollar, but say he
was cracked. He could move about passing forth
a dollar here and there&mdash;that was all. They
would welcome him at Lot &amp; Company’s if he
passed it out quietly enough. The dollar would
go into the Sproxley system and emerge unbroken
to the firm itself, there to be had and held and
marked down in the house of Lot&mdash;Jabez,
Nathan, Eben, Seth, each a part, the jovial Mr.
Rawter a small but visible part&mdash;one hundred
Sproxley-measured cents.... Davy Acton
wouldn’t get one, nor Broadwell, nor the girls upstairs.
The firm would not encourage him passing
beyond the cage of Mr. Sproxley.... There
were many who wanted food and drink and hats&mdash;hats&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was with Bessie Brealt now ... that
night and the kiss. It was another life.... He
went back to those who needed food&mdash;New York
so full of food. Then he felt the heavy wallet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>against his breast&mdash;one paper in there would fill
the open boat with food....</p>

<p>“My God,” he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He didn’t try to explain.... Sometimes he
fell into a little dream as he sat. Once he was
drinking at the narrow throat of a green bottle,&mdash;a
magic bottle whose base was in the sea, and
the trickle that passed through was freshened
drop by drop. But it was a trick like all else in
the world and the drops passed with agonising
slowness. He came to, sucking hard upon his
brass key, his mouth ulcered from it.... There
were times in the long days that he hungered for
the stars almost as for drink; times in the night
when the stars bored him like some man-pageantry
that he had seen too much of; times when the
thought of God was less than the thought of
water; and times when the faith and the glory of
the spirit of the world made thirst a thing to
laugh at, and death whimsical and insignificant....
Sometimes in the night, he fancied the
woman was Bessie Brealt. It would come like a
little suspicion first hardly stirring his faculties;
finally it would be real&mdash;that the singing girl
was there, all but her song. He would sit up rubbing
his eyes in rebellion. Once he had spoken
to be sure.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I,” she said huskily, and the voice
was not Bessie Brealt’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p class="center no-indent">10</p>

<p class="no-indent">They did not speak of ships. Through the
wakeful night hours they watched for the
lights of ships, but they did not speak of vigils.
Their eyes were straining for uncharted shores
during the days, but they did not speak of
land; nor of rain, though they watched passionately
the change and movement of wind and
cloud.</p>

<p>It is true that they suffered less in the days that
followed the passing of Stackhouse. The underworld
was gone from the seat in the stern; sunlight
and sea air had cleansed it from the boat.
They were weaker, but pangs of thirst were
weaker, too. Small pieces of metal in their
mouths kept the saliva trickling. The real difference
was an exaltation which even Bellair shared
at times, and which had come to them the fifth
morning with Fleury’s talk, and with refining
intensity since.</p>

<p>The child was well; his imperative founts still
flowing. She was pure mother; it was the child
that was nourished first, not her own body. She
was first in the passion for his preservation. Indeed,
she would have told them at once had any
change threatened him. But she was the soul of
the fasting too; the austerity of it found deep
sanction within her; and there were moments in
which she bewildered Bellair, for she became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>bright with the vitality which is above the need
of bread.</p>

<p>Fleury talked of God, as Stackhouse had talked
of death. Indeed, there was a contrasting intoxication
in the days and nights of the preacher, but
one without hideous reaction.</p>

<p>“There comes a moment,” he said, “when I am
alone&mdash;when you two are asleep&mdash;that I feel the
weakness. I drink and eat&mdash;perhaps more than
my share. But when we are all together&mdash;sitting
here as now, talking and sustaining one another&mdash;oh,
it seems I was never so happy.”</p>

<p>Bellair suspected that this talk of lapses into
abandonment while others slept was an effort to
make their minds easy on the subject of his share.
Both the Mother and Bellair doubted this; it
preyed upon them. In the main they were one
solution, each separate quality of their individualism
cast into a common pool for the sustaining
of a trinity.</p>

<p>“It changes the whole order,” Fleury declared.
“Why, whole crowds have died of hunger&mdash;in
half the number of days that holy men and women
have fasted as a mere incident of their practice
toward self-mastery. This is our consecration.”</p>

<p>Bellair found it true. He had ceased to marvel
at himself. Deep reconstruction was advanced
within him; and a strange loyalty and endurance
prospered from the new foundations. If this were
self-hypnosis&mdash;very well; if madness&mdash;very well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>too; at least, it was good to possess, seven, eight,
nine days in an open boat, on a one-fifth ration
of water and food. To Bellair, who felt himself
inferior to the others, it appeared that they already
lived what he was thrillingly thinking out.
He remembered his first thoughts of them&mdash;in the
cold worldly manner of a fellow-traveller. It was
almost as far as a man’s emotion can swing, from
what he thought of them now. Before God, he
believed he was right now, and wrong then. Certainly
he would test it out, if he lived to move
among men again.</p>

<p>He thought often about the child’s voice&mdash;at
the moment that the heart of Stackhouse broke&mdash;as
the point of his turning and salvation. This
furnished a clue to many things, though he did
not miss the fact that the world would smile at
his credulity in accepting such a dispensation as
real. The world would say that he had been
driven to far distances of illusion by thirst and
hunger; in fact, that anything which he had seen,
other than the original entity in the eyes of Stackhouse,
was a part of the illusion. Bellair considered
this, and also that in every instance of
late in which he had held the world’s point of
view he had been proven wrong. He granted
the world its rights to think as it chose, but accepted
the dispensation.</p>

<p>There had been good and evil within him. The
balance had turned in favour of the good, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>that cry. It had turned from the self. The purpose
of the Enterer had been to keep him <i>in</i> the
self. It had come from the unfathomed depths
of evil&mdash;that purpose and the devil which he
saw. Bellair had heard repeatedly that some
such <i>dweller</i> appeared to each man who makes
an abrupt turn from the life of flesh to the life
of the spirit. Each of the three had seen something
foreign in the eyes of Stackhouse. It is
true they had not talked of it; possibly to each
it was different in its deadliness; perhaps theirs
was not the demon <i>he</i> saw, since Fleury and the
woman were much farther on the way than he,
but they had been good enough to share responsibility
for the visitation. Indeed, the Faraway
Woman could not have been acting, since a cry
came from her the instant <i>it</i> appeared.</p>

<p>This he loved to study: that his thought of the
child had balanced the whole issue against the
intruder; that something within him had brought
that saving grace of selflessness out of chaos. It
was a squeak, he invariably added, but it had
shown him enough, opening the way. There must
be such a beginning in every man; in fact, there
must come an instant of choice; an instant in
which a man consciously chooses his path, weighing
all that is past against the hope and intellectual
conception of a better life.</p>

<p>Bellair brooded upon this a great deal, especially
on the ninth day, and that was the day,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>Fleury talked&mdash;the holiest of their days in the
open boat. Bellair found many things clearer
afterwards. As soon as he understood fully, he
meant to close it all, so far as his own relation was
concerned. In its very nature it must be given to
others, must be turned to helpfulness. It was a
sort of star-dust which did not adhere to self, but
sought places of innocence to shine from, and used
every pure instrument for its dissemination. The
key to the whole matter was the loss of the sense of
self. Having accepted this, Bellair knew that
he must go up into Nineveh, so to speak. He
trembled.</p>

<p>“We learn by austerities apart,” Fleury said,
“and then we return to men with the story. We
are called up the mountain to witness the transfiguration,
and then are sent with the picture down
among men. Oh, no, we are not permitted to
remain, nor build a temple up there. First we
receive; then we must give. We must lose the
sense of self in order to receive; and having received,
we do not want the sense of self. This
is the right and left hand of prayer&mdash;pure selfless
receptivity, then tireless giving to others. It is
the key to the whole scheme of life&mdash;mountain
and valley, ebb and flow, night and day, winter
and summer, the movement of the lungs and the
heart and the soul. We cannot receive while our
senses are hot with desire; therefore we must become
delicate and sensitive. Having received, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>must make the gift alive through action. Dreaming
is splendid; the dreamer receives. The
dreamer starts all things; but the dreamer becomes
a hopeless ineffectual if he does not make
his dreams come true in matter. That is it. We
are here to make matter follow the dream. That’s
why the spirit puts on flesh&mdash;that’s why we are
workmen. Action is the right hand of thought.”</p>

<p>The preacher was ahead of him in these
thoughts. So often he said just what Bellair
needed, the exact, clearing, helpful thing. For
instance, Bellair had followed his own fascinating
conviction that the world is full of secret
values; that the world is ready to pull together,
only it requires a certain stimulus from without&mdash;some
certain message that would reach and unify
all. Fleury tightened the matter by his expression
of it:</p>

<p>“The socialists are doing great good. The
church is still doing good; the societies that have
turned to the East have heard the great message;
even in commerce there is a new life; everywhere
in the world, the sense of having found <i>some new
spirit</i> which works to destroy the sense of self.
If one great figure should come now&mdash;come saying,
‘You are all good. You are all after the same
thing. One way is as good as another&mdash;only
come.’... What we need is for some one to
touch the chord for us&mdash;to give us the key, as
to an orchestra of different instruments. We are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>all making different notes; and yet are ready for
the harmony&mdash;some of us intensely eager for the
harmony. The great need is for a Unifier....
It seems that we, here in the small boat, can see
America so much clearer, than when we were
there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair had felt this a thousand times.</p>

<p>“The greatest story in the world is the story
of the coming of a Messiah&mdash;the one who may
chord for us. I think He will come. He will
come out of the East, his face like the morning
sun turned to the West. Don’t you see&mdash;we are
all like atoms of steel in a chaos? You know
what happens when a voltage of electricity is
turned upon a bar of steel? Order comes to the
chaos; the atoms sing, all turned the same way.
That Voice must come&mdash;that tremendous voltage
of spiritual electricity&mdash;that will set us all in
harmony&mdash;all with our tails down stream.”</p>

<p>And Fleury finished it all by pointing out what
had happened to them in the small boat. They
had lost separateness; they were each for the
others.</p>

<p>“That’s what must happen in America, in the
world,&mdash;the pull of each for the whole&mdash;the harmony.
You have seen an audience in the midst
of great message or great music&mdash;they weep together.
They cry out together. They are all
one. That’s the story. That is what must happen.
It will happen when the Unifier comes. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>is the base of all gospel&mdash;that we are all one in
spirit. Don’t you see it&mdash;every message from the
beginning of time has told it? All one&mdash;all one&mdash;our
separateness is our suffering, our evil. To return
to the House of Our Father&mdash;that is the
end of estrangement.”</p>

<p>... And Fleury was the one who had ceased
to talk. But he had acted, too.... They saw
that he was held by some power of his giving to
them. He was like light. He had given the whole
material force of his body to hold off that destruction
which had come with the dying of Stackhouse.
He had not eaten, even as they had eaten.
They feared for him, because he was the centre
and mainspring of their pilgrimage. Especially
this haunt became more grippable in the heart of
the ninth night.... There was a small tin of
water left, less than three pints, very far from
clean; and somewhat less than a pound of crackers.
Bellair awoke to find Fleury gone from his
place between him and the woman. He was in
the stern, in the old seat of Stackhouse, praying.
... Fleury met the tenth day with an exaltation
that awed Bellair and the woman; and there came
from it a fear to Bellair’s heart that had nothing to
do with self, nor with the Mother, nor the Gleam.</p>

<p>They were all weak, and two men utterly weak.
Through their will and denial, and the extraordinary
force and health of her own nature, the child
had not yet been dangerously denied. It had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
a sort of natural religion with the three&mdash;a
readiness to die for the Gleam.</p>

<p>“This is our last day,” said Fleury, before the
western horizon was marked clear.... The
Faraway Woman told them another story of what
the wise old shepherd dog told the puppies&mdash;that
it was better to begin on crackers and water&mdash;and
end on cookies and cream....</p>

<p class="center no-indent">11</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair believed about this being the last day.
The authority was quite enough, but there was
still something akin to eternity in the possible
space of another daylight and distance. The
announcement did not bring him an unmixed
gladness, for the mysterious fear of the night
haunted him&mdash;the thing that had come to him
under the full and amazing moon while Fleury
prayed.... Day revealed no sign. They sat
speechless and bowed under the smiting noon&mdash;the
little boat in the wide, green deep under a
fleckless, windless sky, proud of its pure part in
infinite space.</p>

<p>That was the day the child moaned, as significantly
for the ears of men, as for the mother.
He was a waif to look at&mdash;the little heart at
times like one of them in stoicism&mdash;then nestling
to the mother-breast and the turning away in
astonishment and pain. The Mother’s eyes were
harrowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“This is our last day,” Fleury repeated.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then drink and eat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I did&mdash;it is&mdash;it is&mdash;oh, I did!”</p>

<p>“Land or rain or a ship, I do not know&mdash;but
this is the last day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair regarded him, between his own wordless
vapourings of consciousness. The preacher
was like a guest, not of earth altogether&mdash;like one
who would come in the evening.... Yes, that
was it. He was like the old man who came to
Olga, only young and beautiful. It did not occur
to Bellair now that he was regarding his friend
with a quality of vision that a well-fed man never
knows.... That which he had fancied placid
and boyish was knit and masterful. The cheeks
and temples were hollowed, but the eyes were
bright. There is a brightness of hunger, of fever,
of certain drugs, but these were as different as
separate colours&mdash;and had not to do with this
man’s eyes. Nothing that Bellair knew but starlight
could be likened&mdash;and not all starlight.
There was one star that rose late and climbed
high above and a little toward the north&mdash;solitary,
remote, not yellow nor red nor green nor
white, as we know it&mdash;yet of that whiteness which
is the source of all. Bellair had forgotten the
name, but Fleury’s eyes made him think of it.</p>

<p>... The woman’s head was lying back. Something
that Bellair had noted a hundred times,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>without bringing it actually into his mind’s front,
now appeared with all the energy of a realisation.
Her throat was almost too beautiful. The diverging
lines under the ear, one stretching down to
the shoulder, the other curving forward around
the chin, were shadowed a little deeper from her
body’s wasting, but the beauty was deeper than
flesh, the structure itself classic. It was the same
as when he had noted her finger-nails. Beauty had
brought him a kind of excitement, and something
of hostility&mdash;as if he had been hurt terribly by
it long ago. But this was different; these details
had come one by one, as he was ready. Her integrity
had entered his heart before each outer
symbol. He had not seen her at all at first; recalled
the queer sense of hesitation in raising his
eyes across the table in the cabin of the <i>Jade</i>. He
had studied her face in the open boat, but something
seemed to blur his eyes when she turned to
him to speak. Two are required for a real understanding.
As yet they had not really met, not
yet turned to each other in that searching silence
which fathoms. But the details were dawning
upon him. Perhaps that was the way of the Faraway
Woman&mdash;to dawn upon one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day was ending&mdash;their shadows long upon
the water. Fleury raised his hand as he said:</p>

<p>“It is surer to me than anything in the
world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>
<p>“What, Fleury?” Bellair asked, though there
was but one theme of the day.</p>

<p>“That this is our last day in the open boat.”</p>

<p>Bellair did not answer. His own voice had
a hideous sound to him and betrayed his misery.</p>

<p>“It was the <i>too-great light</i>&mdash;that I saw,” the
preacher added huskily. “It began last night as
I prayed. I saw that this was the last day for
us&mdash;but more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I saw something about you as you prayed,”
the woman said.</p>

<p>Fleury surprised them now, taking a sup of
water. They saw that he had something to say
about God and the soul of man&mdash;that was the
romance he worshipped. They listened with awe.
In Bellair’s heart, at least, there was a conviction
that tightened continually&mdash;that they were not
long to hear the words of the preacher.</p>

<p>“... For two years I have been in the dark
and could not pray. Before that I prayed with
the thought of self, which is not prayer. I could
not stay as a church leader without praying. I
said I would pray when I could pray purely for
them. I told them, too, that I could not look
back in service and adoration to the Saviour of
another people who lived two thousand years ago.
They called me a devil and a blasphemer. For
two years, I have tried to serve instead of to pray,
but no one would listen, no one would have me.
They said I was insane, and at times I believed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>it. At last, it came to me that I must go away&mdash;to
the farthest part of the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He turned yearningly to the woman.</p>

<p>“And then you came with your strength and
faith.”</p>

<p>Now to Bellair:</p>

<p>“And you came with the world in your thoughts,
and I made the third. We went down into the
wilderness together&mdash;with that other of the underworld.
<i>It was a cosmos.</i> It has shown me all
I can bear. Last night, it came to me that I <i>could</i>
pray for you. It came simply, because I loved you
enough&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His face moved from one to the other, his hand
fumbling the dress of the child beside him.</p>

<p>“It was very clear. As soon as I loved you
enough, I could pray for you, without thought
of self. It was the loss of the self that made it
all so wonderful. And as I prayed, the light
came, and the Saviour I had lost, was in the light.
And the light was Ahead; and this message from
Him, came to my soul:</p>

<p>“<i>I am here for those who look ahead; and for
those who turn back two thousand years, I am
there. Those who love one another find me
swiftly.</i>”</p>

<p>Bellair scarcely heard him. Fleury’s eyes were
light itself. The man’s inner flame had broken
through. Something incandescent was within
him; something within touched by the “glittering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>plane.” But it did not mean future years together.
Bellair had wanted that.... Fleury
smiled now, his eyes lost in the East. He lifted
his hand.</p>

<p>“It always comes from the East,” he said
strangely.</p>

<p>Bellair had searched that horizon a few moments
ago. He knew exactly how the East had
looked&mdash;a thin luminous grey line on the green,
brightening to Prussian blue, then to vivid azure.
He dared not look now, but watched the woman.</p>

<p>Straining and terror were in her eyes&mdash;then
sudden light, a miracle of light and hope, then her
cry.</p>

<p>Bellair seemed to see it in her mind&mdash;the
smudge upon the horizon&mdash;before he turned. It
was there&mdash;a blur on the thin grey line.</p>

<p>To lift the oars was like raising logs of oak,
but he shipped the pair at last, listening for the
words of the others and watching their faces. It
seemed simpler than straining his eyes to the East.
Fleury tried to raise the overcoat from the bottom
of the boat, but it fell from his hands, and he
sank back smiling:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “They’re coming.
They’ll see us soon.”</p>

<p>To Bellair it was like seeing a ghost, that smile
of Fleury’s. It meant something that in the future
would be quite as important to him as the ship’s
bearing down to lift them up. He pulled toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>the east&mdash;felt the old fainting come, pulled
against that,&mdash;to the east, until a low, thundering
vibration was all about him, like the tramp
of death. Perhaps it was that&mdash;the thought
flickered up into form out of the deep blur....
He was drinking water again. This time he did
not fight.</p>

<p>“You may as well have yours, Bellair, man,”
Fleury was saying, “and you need not row.
They’re coming. It’s a ship coming fast. There
is light for them to see us well&mdash;if they do not
already&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t drunk!”</p>

<p>“Bless you, I’ll drink now.”</p>

<p>The woman handed him the water. The cup
was in his hand. He covered merely the bottom
of the cup, and made much of it as if it were a
full quart.</p>

<p>“The fact is&mdash;I’m not thirsty,” he said pitifully,
when he saw their faces.</p>

<p>“You’re all in,” Bellair said in an awed tone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the prolonged ending of that day Bellair
watched the steamer near, but his thoughts
were not held to the beauty of her form, nor the
pricking out at last of her lights. He stood against
the bare pole in the dusk, and waved and called&mdash;his
voice little and whimsical. It seemed to falter
and cling within their little radius, then run back
to his ears&mdash;a fledgeling effort. But the deep baying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of the steamer answered at last. Even that
could not hold Bellair’s thoughts.... She was
coming straight toward them now. If it were
death and illusion, so be it; at least that is what he
saw.</p>

<p>“It would be all right&mdash;except for him,” Bellair
said to the woman.</p>

<p>“I tell you all is well,” said Fleury. “Only I
ask&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” they said, when he paused.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them separate us&mdash;when we are on
board the ship to-night. I want to be with you
both to-night&mdash;we three who have seen so much
together&mdash;and the little man.”</p>

<p>... They heard her bells and the slackening
of the engines. She was coming in softly like
an angel, bringing the different life, a return to
earth it was. The woman was weeping. Bellair
could not have spoken without tears....</p>

<p>Just now through the evening purple, he saw
<i>that</i> star in the east, off the point of the steamer’s
prow.</p>

<p>“Fleury,” he said, “tell me&mdash;what is that one&mdash;that
pure one&mdash;I have forgotten?”</p>

<p>The preacher’s eyes followed his finger.</p>

<p>“That is Spika&mdash;Spika of the Virgin,” he said.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">12</p>

<p class="no-indent">The engine had stopped. She neared in the deep
dusk, a harp of lights, and with the steady sound
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>of a waterfall.... She was just moving. There
was a hail from the heights.</p>

<p>“Hai!” answered Bellair. It was a poor,
broken sound.</p>

<p>Now they felt the strange, different heat of the
steamer&mdash;earth-heat&mdash;and a thousand odours registered
on their clean senses&mdash;milk and meat, coal-smoke,
and the steam of hot ashes, perfumes,
metal and paint.... A hoarse voice called
down:</p>

<p>“Are any of you sick&mdash;infectious?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;just hunger and thirst&mdash;clean as a new
berth.”</p>

<p>It was Bellair again.</p>

<p>“Stay off well. We’re putting down a ladder.
Watch the green light.”</p>

<p>They saw it come down to them&mdash;to the very
water. Then they were uplifted. This was the
world coming back&mdash;but a changed world. A
great kindness had come over all men. Bellair
saw the tears in the eyes of the people gathered
on the deck. He almost expected to see Bessie
Brealt there.... Perhaps the change had
come from her singing.... There was a choke
in the voices of the people gathered around
them.</p>

<p>“Please,” he managed to say, “don’t keep us
apart to-night&mdash;we three. Please let us be together.”</p>

<p>And down the deck-passage he heard the voices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>of women, and among them, the Faraway
Woman’s voice, in answer:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go with you thankfully&mdash;but not
for long. My companions and I must be together
very soon. We three&mdash;to-night&mdash;it is promised
between us.”</p>

<p>There was no voice from Fleury.</p>

<p>The kindness of every one, that was like a
poignant distress to Bellair. He dared not speak;
in fact, there was danger of him breaking down
even without words. The eyes about him were
searching, in their eagerness to help. An Englishman
came forward at intervals and gripped his
hand; a German spoke to others of the remarkable
condition of the boat and its three, after ten
days; another German moved in and out helping,
without any words, though his eyes lifted Bellair
over several pinches of emotion. The American
ship-doctor was the best of all; young, gruff,
humorous, quick-handed, doing and saying the
right thing.... They brought him stimulants
and sups of water by the teaspoon. The merest
aroma of thin broth in the bottom of a tea-cup was
lifted to his lips. He was helped to a hot bath; a
splendid quiet friendliness about it all. Now it
occurred to Bellair that they were tremendously
eager to hear his story. He wanted to satisfy
them....</p>

<p>“It was the fifth day&mdash;that Stackhouse died,”
he was saying, though he was mistaken. “Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
you’ve heard of him ... owns a lot of ships
and islands down here.... That was the climax
for us. He died hard and he was a big man&mdash;but
we did not murder him.... His body did not
sink....”</p>

<p>There was a boom of running water in the bathroom;
the steam rising. Bellair’s voice was ineffectual.
The face of the ship-surgeon bent to
him in the steam, saying:</p>

<p>“Cut it&mdash;there’s plenty of time.... Leave it
all to us.... I say, lean back. You’ve got a
bath coming. Guess you’ve never been on a sick-list
before. We can wait for the story.”</p>

<p>Bellair did try to lean back. One by one, the
sheathes of will power that he had integrated in
the past ten days relaxed. It was strange to feel
them go. They had come hard, and they were
correspondingly slow to ease in their grip. He
had to be told again and again&mdash;to be helped to
rest. It was good to think that a man does not
lose such hard-won strength more easily than it
comes&mdash;that one, in fact, has to use the same force
to relax with. It was all delightful, this friendliness,
the ease of his body, and the giving&mdash;the
giving into human arms of great kindliness, and
the sense of the others being cared for similarly.
They had fixed a berth for him, when he said:</p>

<p>“You know we are to be together to-night. It
was a compact between us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The surgeon was out and in. It occurred to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>Bellair that he was attending the other two....
He repeated his wish to the surgeon about joining
the others as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“They’re all alike,” the latter said. “They’re
all thinking about getting together again....
Good God, man, you’ve had ten days of steady
company. You ought to sleep&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is a compact between us.... Is he&mdash;is
he?”</p>

<p>It came to Bellair that this man might be able
to tell him the truth, but the surgeon was now
at the door speaking to one of the Germans. He
vanished without turning....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were together later in one of the empty
cabins of the German liner, <i>Fomalhaut</i>, bound
for Auckland; and only the American doctor came
and went. The child was asleep in the berth beside
Fleury. The two others sat near.</p>

<p>The extraordinary moonlight of the night before,
when Bellair had awakened to find the
preacher at prayer, had left the spirit of its radiance
upon Fleury’s face. It was there now&mdash;and
such a different face from which his eyes, falsified
by New York, had seen at first. This was the
real Fleury&mdash;this lean, dark, white-toothed
gamester, features touched by some immortal glow
from that orient moon; whose smile and the quality
of every word and gesture, had for him a
gleam of inspiration and the nobility of tenderness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
The man had risen in Fleury&mdash;that was
the secret. And this that had risen in Fleury could
not die.</p>

<p>But the flesh was dying. Bellair had known it
in the dusk while the steamer neared. He knew
that the woman understood&mdash;from her face which
leaned toward the berth continually, from the
suffering in her eyes and the dilation of sensitive
nostrils.... For ten days, as much as he could,
Fleury had betrayed himself. Custodian of the
food and water, he had served them well. And
that day of the Stackhouse passing&mdash;if it were not
all a hideous dream, as Bellair fancied at times&mdash;he
had not given a balance of strength that had
not returned, to fight off the will of the Intruder.</p>

<p>The flesh was dying, but this that had risen in
Fleury could not die. Their other companion
had gone down, clothed in hair and filth and the
desire of a beast, taking the remnant of the man
with it.</p>

<p>Thus it had come to Bellair&mdash;the vivid contrast
of cavern and high noon. It was all in the
two deaths, the enactment of the second, as yet
unfinished.... New York and all life moved
with countless tricks and lures to make a man
lose his way, lose his chance to rise and die with
grace like this. New York was like one vast Lot
&amp; Company.</p>

<p>Fleury’s head was upon the knees of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>woman. Bellair had not seen her take him. For
this last hour, the three were as one. There was a
cry from Bellair that the woman heard all her
days:</p>

<p>“Oh, Fleury, do you have to go?”</p>

<p>So far as time measures, the silence was long
before Fleury answered, and then only to say:</p>

<p>“Take my hand, Bellair.”</p>

<p>He came up from a deep dream to obey. It had
been as if he were out under the stars again,&mdash;Fleury
talking from the shadows near the woman&mdash;the
rest, vastness and starlight.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>too-great</i> light, Bellair. It came when
I could stand it. As soon as I could love you
enough I could pray. It is the loss of the sense
of self that made it wonderful. The Light and
His voice came from ahead.</p>

<p>“‘<i>I am here for those who look ahead, and
for those who turn back two thousand years, I
am there. Those who love one another find me
swiftly.</i>’... This is dying of happiness.”</p>

<p>In the silence, the low lights of the cabin came
back for their eyes. They heard him say at the
last:</p>

<p>“... I love you both and respect and thank
you both. We found our happiness in the open
boat.... And Bellair, when you go back to
New York, do not stay too long. It is right for
you to go, but do not stay too long.... And
dear Bellair&mdash;always follow the Gleam.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>
<p>The Doctor came. It was his step in the passage
that roused them. He bent to the face, then
searched the eyes of the woman. She could not
find his.... Bellair was puzzled. The head
was in her lap, yet the preacher seemed behind
them, and still with something to say. They were
not sure at first that it was the Doctor who asked:</p>

<p>“Why did you not call me?”</p>

<p>He repeated the question.</p>

<p>“He told us&mdash;you would come afterward,” Bellair
said in a dazed way.</p>

<p>“Yes, he wanted it so,” said the woman.</p>

<p>The Doctor stared at them. “Are you two going
to pull off anything further to-night, or are
you going to get the rest you need, and attend to
the nourishment you need?”</p>

<p>“We’re under orders now, Doctor,” said Bellair....</p>

<p>“If I should want him in the night&mdash;if I should
be frightened, you would let him come?”</p>

<p>It was the Faraway Woman who asked this of
the Doctor, her hand touching Bellair’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” the Doctor answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“We’ve been together in strange things,” Bellair
explained. “And now you see, our friend is
gone.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The door was open between their cabins, but
Bellair was not called. Once he heard the child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>cry, but it was quickly hushed.... He thought
it must be near morning at last, and went on deck.
He was not suffering, except from lassitude, deep
languor and numbing strangeness that Fleury was
not near him&mdash;that the woman was not sitting in
her place forward.... It was just after midnight,
the moon still high, the weather the same.
... He was not seen. Three men were seated
smoking in the lee of one of the engine-room funnels,
the light from the dining-saloon on their
knees. The Doctor joined them, and said presently:</p>

<p>“... It’s a bit deep for me. They’ve been in
an open boat ten days. Old Stackhouse, well-known
down here, died of thirst the fourth or
fifth day, but these two and the infant have lived
through it. The preacher looked all right, but
seems to have suffered a fatal case of happiness
since we lifted him aboard. The two knew it
was coming apparently, and arranged for me to
be absent.... It appears that they made a sort
of pilgrimage to Mecca out of thirst and starvation,
and got away with it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair withdrew softly.</p>

<p>In the long next forenoon when he could not
rise, he wished he had gone into that open door,
when he was on his feet last night. Sometimes
half-dreamily he wished he were back in the open
boat, because she was always there. Something
had taken establishment in his character from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>that ten days. She had never failed&mdash;in light or
dark, in the twilights of dawn and evening, in
moon and star and sunlight&mdash;always there; disclosing
leisurely some new aspect of beauty for
him. He understood now that one does not begin
to see clearly any object until one is attracted
to it&mdash;that all the cursory <i>looking at things</i> around
the world will not bring them home to the full
comprehension.</p>

<p>... He could call to her, but it was like telephoning.
He had never liked that, and beside he
was not the master of his voice. It would not go
straight, but lingered in corners, broke pitifully&mdash;so
that he knew it frightened her&mdash;and the
meanings in his mind which he could not speak,
pressed the tears out of his eyes.... Then there
was pain. His body astonished him. He had
merely been weak and undone last night, but to-day....
And he knew that she was suffering,
not from any sound from her cabin, but because
she did not come. Then <i>they</i> had to feed the
child. This filled him with a rebellion so sharp
that it recalled him to full faculties for a second.
He had to smile at his absurdity.</p>

<p>The second day it was the same, but the third
Bellair arose; and when she heard his step, her
call came. It was still early morning. He found
the child before he looked into her face.</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to be so weak,” she said. “But
to-day&mdash;a little later&mdash;he said I could rise. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>are to be on deck for a half-hour after dinner,
he told me.”</p>

<p>“The little Gleam&mdash;&mdash;” said Bellair....</p>

<p>She was whiter, more emaciated than when they
sighted the <i>Fomalhaut</i>. There had been a crisis
that they had not expected in the relinquishment
of their will-powers.... Yet he saw how perfectly
her face was fashioned.... Her hand
came up to him, warm from the child, the sleeve
falling back to her shoulder&mdash;held toward him,
palm upward. As he took it, all strangeness and
embarrassment left him, and he was something
that he had not been for five years, something
from the Unknowable. But that was not all. He
looked into her eyes and met something untellably
familiar there.</p>

<p>A most memorable moment to Bellair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were on deck together in the afternoon,
the American doctor helping them. They heard
sacred music&mdash;as he walked between them aft.
They reached the rail of the promenade overlooking
the main-deck.... A service was being intoned
in German. Passengers and crew were below,
and in the midst&mdash;leaded and sewn in canvas,
in the cover of a flag&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sound that came from the woman was not
to be interpreted. She turned and left them. Bellair
would have followed but he felt a courtesy
due the Doctor, who had arranged for them not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>to miss the ceremony. Perhaps he had held the
ceremony until they could leave the cabin. Yet
Bellair had already turned away.</p>

<p>“Good God&mdash;&mdash;” said the American. “You
people have got me stopped. I thought this was
a trinity outfit&mdash;that we picked up.”</p>

<p>Bellair took his hand. “It was&mdash;but our friend
left us.”</p>

<p>The Doctor glanced at him curiously, and
pointed down to the body already upon the rail.
“I suppose <i>that</i> has nothing to do with him?” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Not now&mdash;not to watch,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>“I’ll understand you sometime,” the other
added. “Go to her. You’ll probably find her
waiting for you forward.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bellair lay in his berth that night, the open
door between, and he thought of that first real
look that had passed between them. “I’m not just
right yet from the open boat,” he reflected. “I’m
all let down from starvation, a bit wild with
dreams and visions, but I saw old joys there and
old tragedies, and mountains and deserts and&mdash;most
of all, partings. I wonder what I’ve got to
do with them all? It seemed to me that I belonged
to some of those partings&mdash;as if I had
hungered with her before and belonged to her
now&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fleury came into his thoughts. “They were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>certainly great together. It seemed to me that
I did not belong when they were together; and
yet, this morning as I looked down at her&mdash;well,
something of expectancy was there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair found himself lying almost rigid in the
intensity of his hope. Then his thoughts whirled
back to New York&mdash;all unfinished. There was
something in his heart for Bessie&mdash;and something
in the wallet for Bessie. That was in the original
conception, and he must not fail in that; and then
he must clean that name, Bellair, from the black
mark Lot &amp; Company had traced across it. For
a moment he fell to wondering just how he would
go about that. Lot &amp; Company was tight and
hard to move.... A moment later he was somewhere
in an evil and crowded part of New York,
in the dark, Davy Acton holding him fast by
the hand.</p>

<p>“... something of expectancy.”... Was
it in her eyes, or in her lips? Her whole face
came to him now, a picture as clear as life. He
had dwelt upon her eyes before&mdash;and that billowy
softness of her breast, as she lay&mdash;he had
not thought of that. It was like something one
says to another of such moment, that only the
meaning goes home&mdash;the words not remembered
until afterward. And her mouth&mdash;it was like a
girl’s, like a mother’s too, so tender and <i>expectant</i>.
... That word thrilled him. It was the key to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>it all.</p>

<p>He was farther and farther from sleep&mdash;listening
at last with such intensity that it seemed
she must call.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PART_FIVE_THE_STONE_HOUSE_I">PART FIVE<br />
THE STONE HOUSE: I</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> woman awed him quite as much as
in the open boat. The turning of her
profile to the sea had for Bellair a significance
not to be interpreted exactly,
but it had to do with firmness and aspiration and
the future. Fleury was in their minds more than
in speech. She could speak of him steadily, and
this during the sensitiveness of convalescence
which is so close to tears. Perhaps they found
their deepest joy in the child’s fresh blooming.
The ship’s people were an excellent company.</p>

<p>Bellair’s mind adjusted slowly, and by a rather
intense process, to the fact of the Stackhouse wallet.
It was all that the great wanderer had said.
The woman accepted the lifted condition, but it
seemed hard for her faculties to establish a relation
with temporal plenty. Fleury had given
them each a greater thing. They were one in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>that&mdash;keen and comprehensive; indeed their
minds attacked with vigour and ardour this one
thought: somehow to help in drawing off the
brimming sorrows of the world.</p>

<p>It came all at once to Bellair that this was no
new conception. He had heard and read of
<i>helping</i> all his life. A touch, queerly electric,
had come over him as a boy, when a certain old
man passed, and some one whispered in the most
commonplace way, “His whole thought is for
others.”... He had read it in many books;
especially of late, the note had been sounded. It
was getting into the press&mdash;some days on every
page. All the cultic and social ports, into which
he had sailed (like a dingy whaler, he thought)
had spoken of brotherhood, first and last.</p>

<p>Did a thing like this have to be talked by the
few for several thousand years before it broke
its way into the conception of the many, and
finally began to draw the materials of action together?
It had not been new in certain parts
of the world two thousand years ago when Jesus
brought the perfect story of it, and administered
it through life and death. Had there been too
much speech and too little action since; or did
all this speech help; the result being slow but
cumulative, toward the end of the clearly-chiselled
thought on the part of the majority that would
compel the atoms of matter into action, making
good all thoughts and dreams?... He knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>men who sat every Sunday listening courteously
to more or less inspired voices that called upon
them to <i>Love One Another</i>; yet these men, during
the next six days, moved as usual about their
work of rivalry and burning personal desire. Why
was this?</p>

<p>The answer was in his own breast. He had
made a mental conception of the good of turning
the force of one’s life out to others, but he had
not lived it; had never thought seriously of living
it, until now that the results had been shown him,
as mortal eyes were never given before to see.
That was it; men required more than words.
Would something happen to bring to all men at
last the transfiguring facts as they had been
brought to him in the open boat&mdash;squarely, leisurely,
one by one? He was not different from
many men. Given the spectacle of the fruits of
desire and the fruits of compassion side by side,
as he had been forced to regard them&mdash;any one
would understand.</p>

<p>The woman was one of those who had got it
all long ago. She had ceased to speak of it much,
but had put it into action. The child was a part
of her action, and his own love for her&mdash;that new
emotion, deeper than life to him. She had mainly
ceased to speak.... Action and not speech had
been the way of Fleury, his main life-theme, his
first and last words. Formerly Fleury had spoken,
and then emerged into the world of action. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>had been tremendous action&mdash;for them. These
things never die.</p>

<p>“That’s the beauty of them,” he said aloud.
“These things never die.”</p>

<p>“You were thinking of <i>him</i>?” the Faraway
Woman said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Fomalhaut</i> left them at Auckland&mdash;insular,
high and breezy between its harbours and
warm to the heart, from the southern summer.
They took the train to Hamilton, near where she
had lived....</p>

<p>“It seems so long since I was a part of the life
here,” she told him, as they climbed a hill by the
long road&mdash;the same upon which Olga’s Guest
had come, “and yet it really isn’t. You can see&mdash;how
little the Gleam is. He was born here....
There was so much to learn. It has been like
a quick review of all life. When I think of it&mdash;and
feel the child alive, unhurt&mdash;oh, do you know
what it makes me want to do?”</p>

<p>Bellair was thinking of Fleury. He sensed her
emotion, as he shook his head.</p>

<p>“It makes me want to work for you.”</p>

<p>Bellair placed her saying to the account of her
fine zeal for the good of the nearest. He was
very far from seeing anything heroic in his part
of the ten days.... They had paused on the
little hill back of the settlement where she had
lived. With all her coming home, she met no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>acquaintance while he was with her. It was as
if she had come to look, not to enter.... But
there were two days in which she went forward
alone, and Bellair got a foretaste of what it would
mean to be separated. It called to him all the
strength that he had earned.... The Faraway
Woman came back to Hamilton where he waited&mdash;as
one who had hastened. The child was
asleep, and they walked out into the streets together....</p>

<p>They were alone again as in that first night on
board the <i>Fomalhaut</i> when Fleury left them.</p>

<p>“Do you want to stay to make your house near
the Hamilton road?” he asked.</p>

<p>She regarded him quietly, her eyes fixed upon
his face with an incommunicable yearning.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to stay in New Zealand?”</p>

<p>Again she held him with her eyes, before answering:</p>

<p>“It may be well for me here, as anywhere. I
could not stay in America.”</p>

<p>The sun was setting. It was she who broke the
silence:</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> must go away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You knew that from <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p>“From what he said&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“He told me not to stay too long.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he saw it all. Perhaps he saw something
that would keep you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“He saw a very great deal.”</p>

<p>They had been gone two hours. Her steps
quickened, when she thought of the child....
“Yes, I may as well stay in Auckland,” she said.
“Do you know, I should like to stay by the sea&mdash;to
be near it, for remembering&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>That seemed to come very close to Bellair’s
conviction&mdash;that her whole life was turned to the
saint who had passed.</p>

<p>“A little house by the sea,” he said, his mind
picturing it eagerly to relieve the greater matter.</p>

<p>“Just what I was thinking&mdash;a little place out
of Auckland on the bluffs&mdash;overlooking Waitemata&mdash;where
one could see the ships coming
in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you let me help you find it, and arrange
your affairs?”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be happier for me&mdash;if you
would.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go back to Auckland to-night, and start
out looking from there.”</p>

<p>Mainly they followed the shore during their
days of search; but sometimes they found woods
and little towns. There was no coming to the
end of her; she put on fresh perfections every
day, and there were moments in which he was
meshed in his own stupidity for not seeing the
splendour of her at the first moment. He became
possessed of a healthful wonder about women&mdash;how
men like himself wait for years for some companion-soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
finally believing her to be in the sky,
only to find that <i>the nearest</i> was waiting all the
time. The world is so full of illusions, and a
man’s mind is darkest when it seems most clear.</p>

<p>The days were like entering one walled garden
after another, always her spirit vanishing at the
far gate. Beside him was a strong frail comrade,
loving the water and air and sky and wood, as
only a natural woman can love them&mdash;her eyes
shining softly, her lips parted and red as the
sleeping child’s. He was struck with the miracle
of her mouth’s freshness. It was like the mouth
of a city-bred woman, a woman who had forced
her way for years through the difficult passages
of a man’s world, who had met the fighting of
the open, and the heavier-line fighting of solitude....
Here Bellair’s diffidence intervened. Moreover,
it was a mouth that could say unerring
things.</p>

<p>“She is a fine weave,” he would say, after the
partings at night.</p>

<p>She held through every test. The enthralling
advance guard never failed&mdash;that winged immortal
something ahead. Often in some little inn
or in the hotel at Auckland during the nights, he
found himself in rebellion because he could not
go to her. Always in the open boat he had awakened
to find her there, and on the night that
Fleury passed, she had asked to have him within
call&mdash;but those times were gone. The world had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>intervened that little bit.... There was one
summer day and a bit of forest to enter, a moment
surpassing all. Her arms and fingers, her eyes
and breast were all fused with emotions. She gave
him back his boyhood that afternoon in a solemn
wordless ceremony, but all his diffidence of boyhood
came with it.</p>

<p>The woods were full of fairies to her; there
were meanings for her eyes in the drift of the wind
over the brown pools. She caught the woodland
whispers, was a part of sweet, low vibrations of
the air.... Her eyes had come up to his, fearless
and tender; yet for the life of him, he could
not have been sure that they wanted anything
he could give. For the first time he marvelled
now at the genius of self-protection which women
have put on, instinct by instinct, throughout all
this age of man, this age of muscle and brain, in
which the driving spirit of it all has no voice....
There was one branch above her that was
like hawthorn, and full of buds. The little Inverness
cape that she wore was tossed back, and
her arms were held up to the branches....
Strangely that instant he thought of her story&mdash;the
coming of The Guest&mdash;the thought she had
held all the years, the strange restless beauty of its
ideal&mdash;the mothering beauty of it that seemed to
him now endless in power. Such a mystery came
to him from her arms&mdash;as if she were holding
them up to receive perfection, some great spiritual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>gift.... It was startlingly native to her, this
expectancy&mdash;the pure receptivity of it, and the
thought of beauty in her mind. A woman could
command heaven with that gesture, he thought,
and call to earth an archangel&mdash;if her ideal were
pure enough.</p>

<p>A sudden gust of love came over him for her
child. He thought he had loved it before, but it
was startling now, filling him, turning his steps
back toward the place where it lay....</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">And all the time that they were searching widely
from Auckland for their house, a little Englishwoman,
growing old, sat waiting for them within
an hour’s ride from the city. They found her at
last and her stone cottage, rarely attractive in its
neglect; and from the door-yard, an Odessian vista
of sky and harbour and lifted shore-line....
They had even passed it before, their eyes
turned farther afield. Bellair couldn’t ignore the
analogy of the nearest woman, nor the stories of
all the great spiritual quests&mdash;how the fleeces on
a man’s doorstep turn golden, if he can only
see.</p>

<p>“I knew some one would come,” the little
woman said. She had a mole on her nose and
eyes that twinkled brightly. “In fact, I prayed.”</p>

<p>Bellair smiled and thought of Fleury’s saying&mdash;that
those who turn back two thousand years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>would find Him.... She had kept a boarding-house,
and now the work was too much. Besides,
the children of a younger sister back in the home
in Essex were calling to her.</p>

<p>“They need me in England,” she repeated.
“And here, I have been unable to keep up the little
house. I am too old now. My young men were
so dear about it, but I was not making them comfortable.
One’s heart turns home at the
close&mdash;&mdash;” She thought they did not understand;
and explained all the meanings carefully&mdash;how in
age, the temporal needs are not so keen, and the
mind wanders back to the elder places.... Bellair
stood apart, knowing that the two women
could manage better alone.... The cottage
faced the east a little to northward, and had been
built of the broken rocks of the bluff and shore,
its walls twenty inches thick and plastered on
the stone within. The interior surprised them
with its size, two bedrooms facing the sea and
two behind, beside the living room (for dining,
too, according to the early design) and the kitchen.
They took it as it was, furniture and all, and
loved the purchase.</p>

<p>For several days she remained with them,
helped and explained and amplified&mdash;suggesting
much paint. Each day for an hour or so, there
were tears. She had found her going not so easy,
and the process was slow to accustom herself to
the long voyage; the sense of detachment could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>not be hurried. She wanted them to see her whole
plan of the place. Her dream had been to have
evergreens cut in patterns and flower-beds in stars
and crescents. Meanwhile with her years had
grown up about her the wildest and most natural
garniture of the stone cottage; vines and shrubs,
the pines putting on a sumptuousness of low
foliage altogether unapproved.</p>

<p>Gradually it was all forgotten but the long
voyage, and Bellair could help in making the details
of that as simple and desirable as possible.
In fact, he went with her to the ship....</p>

<p>“She was dear to us, and we shall miss her
always,” the Faraway Woman said that night....
She would never come back. It was a parting,
but the very lightness of it moved them.
They wondered if they had done all they could.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad the means were not at hand for
her to paint the stone-work,” Bellair said firmly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she would think we lack interest,”
the woman added, as she glanced at the smoky
beams of the ceiling. The years had softened
them perfectly.</p>

<p>“She wanted them washed the very first thing,”
said Bellair, “and varnished. If she had stayed
much longer we would have been forced to paint
something.”</p>

<p>In the days that followed, a softness and summery
bloom came continually to the Faraway
Woman’s eyes. His heart quickened when she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>turned to him. They moved in and out from the
cottage to grounds, again and again.</p>

<p>“It’s unreal to me,” she would say. “I wonder
if it will ever seem ours? I know it won’t, while
you are away. I could live here fifty years until
I seemed a part of the cottage and grass and
trees, and I would feel a pilgrim resting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is part of you now, and always has been,”
he said. “You are at home on high ground and
you must have the sea-distance. They belong to
you. I think that is what made you so hard for
me to understand.”</p>

<p>“Was I hard for you?”</p>

<p>“I was so fresh from the little distances and
the short-sight of things&mdash;from looking
down&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wonder if any one ever was so willing to be
seen on his worst side?” she asked. “I really believe
you know very little about yourself....
He saw&mdash;the real side.”</p>

<p>“He saw good everywhere,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>“... I wonder why I was strange to you at
first?” she repeated, after a moment. “You were
not strange to me.”</p>

<p>“Not when I spent so much time at the great
cane chair?”</p>

<p>“No. You seemed to be studying. I could
see that you didn’t belong there. You appeared
to be interested in it all&mdash;as if he were a part
of the ship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“And you didn’t seem to belong at all to my
eyes,” he told her. “You belonged out in the
distances of ocean. You came closer and closer
during the days in the open boat&mdash;but here you
belong. It seems to me that you have come home&mdash;and
how I wish I could stay, too.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could stay&mdash;but I know that there
is unfinished work in New York.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how <i>he</i> knew?” Bellair questioned.</p>

<p>“He saw very clearly. He was not flesh at all&mdash;that
last day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“After the night&mdash;when he prayed.... You
saw him that night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Her innate sense of beauty startled him afresh
every day. All that he idealised was an open book
to her. Bellair had planned his house in the New
York room. The greatest houses are planned so,
by those who suffer and are confined. It had not
come to him in the form of this stone cottage by
the sea. This was not his dream that had come
true here, although in many ways it was fairer
than his dream. Very plainly, this little rock-bound
eyrie was of her fashioning&mdash;the very
atoms of it, drawing together to conform with the
picture in her mind. He loved the place better
so. Perhaps her thought of a home had been the
stronger.</p>

<p>“It is almost perfect now,” she would say.
“The neglect has made it right. A few roses, some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>bee-hives, vines and perennials&mdash;the rest is just
clearing and cleansing. I could go over all the
leaves and branches with a soapy sponge. The
rest is to prune and thin and cleanse&mdash;so the sunlight
is not shut from anywhere altogether&mdash;so it
all can breathe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He caught the picture in her mind&mdash;foliage cut
away for the play of sun and wind everywhere&mdash;the
chaste and enduring beauty of leaf and
stone and moving water. And now appeared a
bit of her nature quite as real:</p>

<p>“And then those extra two rooms, I could rent
them and give board&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you don’t have to.”</p>

<p>“I have always had much to do. I must have
work now.”</p>

<p>She had no realisation of property; material
poverty was a part of her temperament. She was
superbly well, and could only remain so by the
expenditure of ample energy. Bellair saw the
Martha soul, the mother of men, a breadgiver.
He thought of the passion of men for the vine-women,
and of the clinging sons they bear....
He lingered over a ship, and another. They
toiled together like two peasants in the open, the
baby sitting in the sun, the house ashine within.
She would have only the simple things. She
loved fine textures, but only of the lasting fabrics
in woods and wares. She was content to
carry water and trim lamps. She loved the stones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>and the low open fires. Often she turned away
seaward, as he had seen her from the <i>Jade’s</i> rail,
and from the bow seat of the open boat. Once
in the garden, he made the child laugh, to bring
back her eyes, and she said:</p>

<p>“I love it so here, but I don’t want to love it,
so that it would hurt terribly, if it were taken
away.”</p>

<p>This was but one side. There were other moments,
in which Bessie and New York and all
that he and the Faraway Woman had been,
seemed fused into a ball of mist whirling away,
and they stood together, man and woman, touching
sanity at last in a world of power and glory.
It was not then a time for words.... Once their
hands went out together, and holding for a
moment, Bellair had the strange sense of the self
sinking from him. He could not feel his hand
or any part of his being&mdash;as if it were a part of
her, two creatures blent into one, and an indescribable
rush of something different than physical
vitality.</p>

<p>And once sitting with her under the lamp in
the evening, he drew again that sense of peace
that had come in the queer darkness on the deck
of the <i>Jade</i>. It had to do with the mountains&mdash;as
if they had finished with the valleys, and were
ascending together in the strong light of the mountains.</p>

<p>And then there was passion&mdash;that plain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>straight earth drive. Bellair was strange about
this with the Faraway Woman. This passion
was like the return of an old hunting companion,
so natural in the wilds, but strange and out of
place in his newly-ordered life. It had come from
the Unknowable, and he had supposed it lost in
that wilderness. It dismayed him that <i>she</i> should
call it forth, but she called from him everything
day by day, and no day the same. He had lost
much of the old, but not that passion. And the
nature of it which she called had a bewildering
beauty.... But there was much to keep the old
native of the wilds from really entering. The
world would have called Bellair’s idealism <i>naïve</i>;
and there was something of Fleury in the very
solution of their lives&mdash;not a finger-print of passion
in all that relation. There was the Unfinished
Story of Ogla’s Guest. Finally there was
the Gleam.</p>

<p>Life was very full and rare to Bellair, but
there seemed always a new ship in the harbour
flying Blue Peter for California.... In the
main, they forgot themselves, as unwatched man
and woman, slept under the same roof and had
their food together; at least, Bellair forgot it for
hours at a time. It seemed the very nature of
life; the purity of it all so obvious.... One
afternoon he came up from the city in a cool
south wind; a grey afternoon, the sunset watery
and lemon-hued. He was thinking of the ship
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>that would float Blue Peter to-morrow. The
homely scent of damp bark burning quickened his
senses, as he crossed the yard, and he heard her
singing to the child. Somehow the woodsmoke
had brought back to him a Spring day in the
northern woods&mdash;grey light and dark pools, all
foliage baby-new, a song-sparrow pair trilling
back and forth from edge to open....</p>

<p>He saw her in one of the rare flashes of life.
She was sitting by the fireplace, the nearest window
across the room. Her figure was softened in
the deep grey light to the pure sensousness of
motherhood&mdash;except her face, hands and boots,
and that which she held. These were mellowed
in the faintest orange glow from the firelight.
Her back was curved forward, her face bent to
the baby’s head, held high in the hollow of her
arms. The dress was caught tightly about her
ankles&mdash;a covering pliant almost as a night-robe,
but that was a mystery of the shadows. She was
like the figure of some woman he had seen somewhere&mdash;some
woman of the river-banks, but this
a Madonna of the firelight. He passed on, and
waited before speaking.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">They went a last time to the city.... There
was a place for a chair, and they had seen
an old urn in a by-street which belonged near
the Spring. They felt that these products of
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>men had to be just so, and that they had
earned a great boon in being given a part at
stone cottage. The things that were brought there
must endure; must reason together in long leisure
concord, putting on the same inner hue at the
last and mellowing together as old friends, or old
mates. This time, Bellair’s eyes did not meet the
city quite as before; it was not as a stranger exactly,
who rambles through a port while his ship
lies in the offing. His real berth was an hour’s
ride back from the city and made of stone. Perhaps
later he would find work to do here....
A child passed them in the store, and brought the
change after their purchase&mdash;a boy of twelve or
fourteen, his face old with care. It made Bellair
think of Davy Acton at Lot &amp; Company’s. They
bought a bit of glass, a bit of silver, some
linen and a rug, and rode home with their arms
full.</p>

<p>Another letter had come from one of the Island
headquarters of Stackhouse, in answer to Bellair’s
inquiry concerning affairs. The papers in
the wallet had given him clues to the various
insular interests; and the replies, without exception,
represented the attitudes of agents ready and
open to authority from without. Stackhouse had
left no centre of force that appeared to have vitality
enough to rise in its own responsibility. Bellair
saw that sooner or later he must make a visit
to these different interests, and that the place of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>the wallet for the time being, at least, amounted to
headquarters. He wrote as explicitly as possible
in reply to the letters, promised to call in due
course, established a freedom where his judgment
permitted, but felt the whole vast business very
loosely in hand. New York was first, and it became
very clear to him, especially on this night,
that New York must be entered upon without
further delay. There was a thrill of dismay in
the thought of the weeks that had passed, and
the dreaming. Dreams were good. He had
needed these days; great adjustments and healings
had taken place. It had been the pleasant
lull between the old and new, the only rest his life
had known, in fact. All its beauty was massed
into the period&mdash;but the dreams must be turned
into action now.</p>

<p>A man may stay just so long in joy. There
are moments in every life when the hour strikes
for parting. The lover does well to leave his
lady then quickly. There is an understanding in
the world that the woman invariably whispers,
<i>Stay</i>, but very often an organisation of force that
makes austerity possible, does not come from the
man alone. If the moment of parting passes, the
two still lingering together, a shadow enters between
them, blurring their faces for each other’s
eyes, dimming the dream.</p>

<p>It does not come from without. The train
missed, the passage paid for and not connected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>the column that marches away, one set broken,
the sentry post to which a strange figure is called&mdash;these
are but matters to laugh at afterward.
The shadow comes between them from their own
failure. It is slow to lift. In the final elevation
of romance, there shows one sunken length....
There is the moment of meeting and the moment
of parting; that which lies between, whether
an hour or generation, forms but the equal third,
for the great love intervals of human kind are
not measured by time, but by the opening of
the doors of the heart. By the very laws of our
being, the doors draw together against rapture
prolonged. The man who crosses the world to
live one day with his sweetheart, sees her at last
in the doorway or the trysting-place as he cannot
see her again; and in the tear of parting, something
different of her, something that has been
occulted, clears magically for his eyes. It must
not blind him to remain, for it is her gift to abide
with him over the divide. It passes, not to come
again if he remains; rapture falls into indulgence;
the fibre of integrity weakens and lets them down
into mere mortals. Man is not ready for the real
revelation of romance in whom a master does not
arise at the stroke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night there was a <i>mew</i> at the door. They
had finished tea and were sitting by the fire. The
woman opened the door and a young tabby-puss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>walked leisurely in, moved in a circle about the
room, tail held high. Chair and table and lounge,
she brushed against, standing upon her toes, eyes
blinking at the fire. The woman brought a saucer
of milk. The visitor drank, as if that were all
very well, but that she could have done well
enough until breakfast. Apparently it was not
her way to land upon friends in a starving condition.
Before the fire, she now sat, adding a point
to her toilet from time to time, inspecting it carefully
and long. Finally she turned to the woman,
hopped upon her knee and settled to doze. She
had accepted them, and they called her <i>Elsie</i>.</p>

<p>“Little-Else-to-do,” said the woman.</p>

<p>They stood beside the child’s bed later that
night.</p>

<p>It rained, and the home closed in upon them
with its cheer and humble beauty. He saw her
hand now in everything&mdash;even the rungs of the
chairs shone in the firelight. The hearth was
swept. Her face&mdash;it was a place of power, and
such a fusion of tenderness was there, the eyes
pure and merciful. All that he had known before
her coming was unfinished, explanatory. She had
shown him what a human adult woman should
be in this year of our Lord. His soul yearned
to her; his whole life nestling to this place of
hers&mdash;as her stone cot nestled to the cliff....
She was always very quiet about her love for the
child when he was near. That was because he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>loved the Gleam so well.... Yet he had seen
the Firelight Madonna.</p>

<p>“You have made it all I can do&mdash;to go away,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I have thought of that&mdash;I might have made
it easier. I have thought of that,” she repeated.
“And yet&mdash;we were so tired. We seemed to need
to be ourselves. It has been beautiful&mdash;to be
ourselves&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It seemed to him that she came nearer, but
that was impossible for the child was between....
Just then his mind finished the other picture&mdash;of
her arms held up to the hawthorn buds&mdash;a
babe of his own in those arms! He would
have fought to prevent its coming, but it visualised
of itself. Had it been that which enchanted the
woodland?... He was silent. She had become
even more to him for this instant. He would not
call it other than beautiful, now that it had come.
She was more than ever the heart of mystery&mdash;the
Quest. She knew all these things&mdash;love and
maternity she knew; even the passionate fluting
of Pan had quickened her eyes; and where she
abode, there was the genius of Home.</p>

<p>So slowly had it come&mdash;perhaps this was not
all. For weeks he had stood by&mdash;day after day,
the heart of her becoming more spacious and
eloquent; one miracle of the woman after another&mdash;finally,
to-night the mystery of all life
about her, for his eyes. Yet to her it was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>mystery; she was <i>of it</i>, rhythmically so. She
knew the dream&mdash;and the life that comes at last
to quicken it. She could love; she could live; she
could wait. She loved God&mdash;but loved Nature,
too. She was spirit, but flesh, too. She was
powerful in two worlds....</p>

<p>So Bellair stood with bowed head, and though
Bessie was forgotten, Fleury was not. It was
still with him that Fleury and the Faraway
Woman were fashioned for each other.... “She
may be so wonderful to me, because she trusts me
to understand&mdash;&mdash;” such was the essence of his
fear. It kept his heart dumb.... That night
she brought a pitcher of water and placed it
upon the hearth, looked up and found him watching.</p>

<p>“For the fairies,” she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That changed him a little, brought her nearer
to words of his; though the effort to speak was
like lifting a bridge. She was leaving for her
room when he managed:</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow&mdash;the steamer. May we
not talk to-night?”</p>

<p>He saw her stop. Then she was coming toward
him so gladly.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you want the rest of the story?”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I have been sorry that <i>he</i> couldn’t
hear it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stood before him, tall and white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“I think you are like me,” she said in a moment.
“I think you have something behind you that you
do not tell&mdash;something that made you what you
are&mdash;yet greater than you seem to yourself....
I would have told you while <i>he</i> was with us, but
you know how the days passed and we could not
hold our thoughts together. Then there were
times when we could not even use our voices....
Do you know that the world is wonderful&mdash;that
the thousands about us do not even dream how
wonderful it is&mdash;how tremendous even miseries
are? Sometimes I think that the tragedies we
meet are our greatest hours.”</p>

<p>“You have met them,” he said, a part of her
spirit almost. “I have seen them in your eyes.
It gave me the sense of shelter with you and
limitless understanding&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“I am thankful for that,” she whispered.
“When we have understanding, we have everything.
Those who in their childhood are made
to suffer horribly are often the ones who reach
understanding. Sometimes they suffer too much
and become dulled and dumb. Sometimes in the
very ache of their story, which can be so rarely
told, they risk the telling to some one not ready. It
aches so, as its stays and stays untold. Oh, the
whole world craves understanding, and yet if we
tell our story to one who is not ready&mdash;we hurt
them and ourselves, and add unto our misery.
There are moments set apart in life in which one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>finds understanding, but the world presses in
the next day, and the story does not look so well.
The spirit of it fades and the actions do not seem
pure when the spirit is out&mdash;so one loses a loved
friend. Oh, I am talking vaguely. It is not my
way to talk vaguely&mdash;but to-night&mdash;it is like a
division of roads, and a story is to be told&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“Do you think the story will diminish in my
mind to-morrow?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not you. I have seen you through the
sunlight and the dark looking into my eyes for
it. If I thought it would diminish in your mind&mdash;yes,
I would tell it just the same. It must be
told&mdash;but life would not be the same. Even this,
our little stone cot, would not be the same. I
should have to become harder and harder to hold&mdash;to
follow the Gleam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“... I shall be Olga in the rest of the story,”
she was saying. “For I am Olga.... The
truth is, I have no other name. There is one that
I used, and another that I formerly used&mdash;but
they are not mine. You shall see.... My
father prospered with the sheep-raising, and
slowly on the long road that you have seen, houses
came one by one, until at last there was a village
about us. My father was like the village father,
and my mother the source of its wisdom in doctoring
and maternal affairs&mdash;she had learned by
bringing forth. But I was not of them&mdash;they all
saw that. The coming of plenty, the coming of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>the people, the coming of men to woo my sisters,
and the maidens my brothers brought for us to
see, before they took them quite away&mdash;none of
these things were so real to me as the coming of
my Guest when I was such a little girl. And
none remembered that&mdash;not even my mother.
Until I ceased to speak of it, they tried to make
me think it was a dream. But I knew that rapture.
It had changed me. I was always to search
for it again. I was always looking for another
such night&mdash;for that afterglow again. I was the
last child and the silent one.</p>

<p>“But all that had to do with children was intimate
and wonderful to me.... I remember once
when we were all girls at home together, and they
were talking&mdash;each of what she should have for
her treasure from the household&mdash;one walnut, one
silver, one an inlaid desk&mdash;and they turned to me
laughingly, for I was not consulted as a rule, I
said I wanted the little hickory cradle in an upper
closet. It was one of those household days which
girls remember.... All was happier then. The
little cradle seemed like a casket in which jewels
had come to my mother&mdash;seven times. We had
all smiled at her first from that hickory cradle....
I went up stairs to look at it&mdash;a dim place
full of life and messages to me. I was weak; my
arms ached; and it was so dear that I dare not say
that it was mine.... My father said the cradle
must belong to the eldest girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“... I began to sense the terrible actuality of
life through the mating of Lois, ten years older,
with a countryman who came for her. For sisters,
Lois and I had always been far apart, and
this stranger who wished to marry her, had nothing
to do with life as I dreamed it&mdash;a child of
twelve. To many, Lois was the loveliest of us&mdash;large,
calm, dark and quiet, very well, slow of
speech, but quick to smile. Had you visited our
house then, you would have remembered my
father’s patriarchal air, the smile of Lois, and the
maternity that brooded over us all. The rest you
would get afterward&mdash;a variety of young people
with different faults and attractions&mdash;I the grey
one, last to be noted. Lois was given credit for
more than she was. I do not love brain or power,
but I seem to love courage. Lois had something to
take the place of these&mdash;not courage&mdash;and no,
not power nor brain. She had sensuousness and
appetite.</p>

<p>“One night I seemed to see what the whole
house was straining for&mdash;a kind of process of
marriage continually afoot. Just now it was
Lois. I remember my father being called into the
front room where Lois and Collinge had been for
an evening&mdash;his face beaming when he came
forth, and my mother’s quiet sanction. There
were conferences after that, dressmaking, the arrangement
of money affairs. And I was suddenly
ill with it. To me, there could be no trade or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>public business. To me, it had to do with a child
and that was consecrated ground. Oh, you must
see it had to be different. I wanted it like a
stroke of lightning. I did not understand but I
wanted it like that&mdash;like a flight of swans&mdash;and
not talk and property transactions. To me it had
to do with rain and frost and the tides and the
pulses of plants&mdash;the silent things. I did not
understand&mdash;but knew that children came to those
who took each other.</p>

<p>“I remember one supper; the countryman talked&mdash;talked
of the marriage day&mdash;the breakfast, the
ceremony&mdash;the end and the dusk, and turned to
Lois with sleepy half-folded eyes. She was smiling
and flushed&mdash;and I looked from face to face
at the table, at my sisters&mdash;and I rushed away
because I could find nothing pure.... Some one
said my mother never looked prettier.... I remember
the flood of honeysuckle perfume that
came to me in the torture of hatred, as I passed
through the distant hall.... And then later
from the top of the stairs, Lois and my mother
were talking, and Lois said:</p>

<p>“‘You know, Mother, we will not have children
for the first three years, at least&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“I was somehow below by her in the lower
hall. She seemed a rosy pig upstanding, marked
red and flaming.... And that night long afterward,
my mother found me and said, ‘You are
getting beyond me, Olga.’ ... But I could only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>think of men and women copying the squirrels,
filling their bins, dressing their door-yards, reaching
for outer things&mdash;and it was back of my very
being&mdash;back of the mother and the patriarch&mdash;back
of the shepherding and the folding&mdash;back
of <i>me</i>. I hated life with destroying hatred&mdash;Lois
wanting the seasons, but unwilling to bring forth
fruit, accepting the countryman’s idea of life....
Can you see that it had the look of death
to me?”</p>

<p>Bellair could only bow his head. To him the
woman was revealing the grim days through which
she had won her poise and power.... She was
telling another incident with the same inclination&mdash;for
the thought of being a mother had been
the one master of her days. He seemed to see the
child, the girl, the younger woman about her&mdash;a
grey-eyed, red-lipped girl, with a waist that was
smaller and smaller as she gained in inches from
fifteen to eighteen&mdash;madness for mothering, passionate
in that, but not passionate for sensation&mdash;her
face sometimes so white, that they would ask
her mother, “Is Olga quite well?”... Yet teeming
with that intensive health that goes with small
bones and perfect assimilation&mdash;that finds all to
sustain life in fruit and leaves ... books, light
sleeping, impassioned with the lives of great
women and the saints&mdash;one of those who come to
the world for devotion and austerity and instant
sacrifice; yet for none of these apart; rather a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>fruitful vine, her prevailing and perennial passion
for motherhood.</p>

<p>“And yet I almost ceased to breathe,” she was
saying, “when I came to understand man’s part in
these things. I felt <i>myself</i> differently after that&mdash;even
children&mdash;but from this early crisis which
so many men and women have met with untellable
suffering, emerged a calm that could not have
come without it. The travail brought me deep
into the truth. For all great things the price must
be paid&mdash;how wonderfully we learned that in
the open boat. There are sordid processes in the
production of all fine things&mdash;even in the bringing
forth of a Messiah.”</p>

<p>She paused, as if she saw something enter the
eyes that had listened so fervently. Bellair
cleared his voice. “I remember something <i>he</i>
said,” he told her. “That matter is the slate&mdash;spirit
the message that is written. The slate is
broken, the message erased, but <i>eyes</i> have seen it,
and the transaction is complete. For the spirit has
integrated itself in expression&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think he said it, for you to tell me now,”
the Faraway Woman whispered.</p>

<p>“Only <i>he</i> could have halted your story,” Bellair
added.</p>

<p>“... I told you when my Guest came in the
afterglow, of the house of our nearest but distant
neighbour; now I am telling you of years
afterward, when there were many houses between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>on the long road, and my playmate Paul had gone
away to Sidney. Lois had long been married. I
was seventeen&mdash;and so strangely and subtly hungering&mdash;for
expression, for something that I did
not know, which meant reality to me, but which
was foreign and of no import to all about me.
Often at evening I stared up the long road....
I remember late one night in the nearest house, the
soft wind brought me the cry of a child. It was
so newly come and it was not well. I went to it
just as I was, though the people had just moved
in and were strange to us. It was thirst&mdash;as we
know. I went to it, as we would have gone to a
waterfall. The door of their house was locked,
but I knocked. The father came down at last.
The lower rooms were filled with unpacked boxes.
I told him why I had come. He talked to me
strangely. He went upstairs and sent the mother
down to me. It did not seem as if I could live
through that night&mdash;and not have my way. She
put her arms about me, led me upstairs to a room
that was not occupied&mdash;save a chair by the window.
I stood there waiting until she returned
with the child.... I saw lights back in our
house when they missed me&mdash;voices, but I could
not go. In the early light I heard the woman saying
to my mother: ‘... We really needed her
so. Baby was restless, but he is much better and
quiet with her. They are very happy together....
Yes, she is safe and well.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The Faraway Woman left him now to go to
the child.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">4</p>

<p class="no-indent">Returning, she put the kettle on, and made tea
in the earthen pot. To Bellair her coming into
the room again was a replenishment&mdash;as if she had
been gone for hours; and this started a pang deep
in his heart, which presently suffused everything
when he realised that his ship had come for him.
It was past midnight.... In reality it was to-morrow
that his ship would sail.</p>

<p>“You listen wonderfully,” she said.</p>

<p>“It seems all about the little Gleam,” he answered.
“It makes everything significant about
the open boat.... I forget to swallow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They laughed together.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I can hardly realise when we
are here&mdash;that this is New Zealand?” she said
presently, “that only a little way back is the long
road and the river and the ravine&mdash;the neighbour’s
house and ours and the other houses between....
I will tell you the rest very quickly&mdash;and oh, let
me tell you first, I am not afraid. In spite of all
I know, I am not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was bending forward across the table.</p>

<p>“... I was a woman when Paul came back
from the distant city&mdash;and came first of all to
me. He was changed&mdash;something excellent about
his face and carriage, and something I did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>understand at all, his face deeper lined, his voice
lower, his words ready. I did not think about
him when he was away. In the first evenings
we passed together, I had only an old-time laugh
for him. I kissed him with something like affection.
We were permitted to be alone together,
and I saw the old look upon my father’s face&mdash;that
I had hated so. That look&mdash;even before the
playmate thing had departed from me. Then I
began to <i>see</i> Paul&mdash;something I could not like
nor understand, a readiness of words, and he was
not wise enough to make them ring deeply. I
seemed to be studying in him the novelty of a
man&mdash;through the eyes of a girl.</p>

<p>“One night we were together in my father’s
house. It was our Spring and raining softly on
the steps. The grass seemed full of odours, and
the vines trembling with life. He kissed me there.
It seemed that I hardly knew. I was looking over
his shoulder into the dark, and I saw a little white
face. It was like a rain-washed flower ... and
to me it was quite everything.</p>

<p>“... Everything that I had known and loved&mdash;compensation
for all that I had missed and
hungered for. Only the little face&mdash;but I knew
the arms were held out to me.</p>

<p>“Paul knew nothing of this. He was not to
blame. It was not he, who carried me away. He
was merely being the man he fancied&mdash;playing
the thing as the world had taught him&mdash;showing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>himself fervent and a man. I could have laughed
at his kisses.... I have nothing against him. It
was his way.... But once he kissed me&mdash;and it
came to me that he was the way&mdash;that he must
join his call to mine.... I could do all but that&mdash;I
need not love him. Can you understand&mdash;it
seemed as if everything was done but that&mdash;that
the little face had already chosen me.... I sent
him away, and I remember long afterward I was
standing on the porch alone. It rained.”</p>

<p>Bellair realised now that she was watching him
with something like anguish. A different picture
of her came to him from that moment&mdash;filed for
the long days apart&mdash;the rapt look of her mouth,
and the pearl in her hair that brought out the
lustre of whiteness from her skin&mdash;full-bosomed,
but slender&mdash;slender hands that trembled and
moved toward him as she spoke.... It was
something for him&mdash;as if he had always been
partly asleep before&mdash;as if she had brought some
final arousing component to his being.</p>

<p>“... My mother did not ask but once. When
I told her&mdash;the horror came to me that she would
die. I had not thought of it before. I had thought
that it was mine&mdash;had seen very little of Paul.
In fact, he had come several times, when I would
not see him.... She called my father&mdash;and it
was all to be enacted again. For a moment, I
thought he would strike me. The most dreadful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>thing to them all was that I was not ashamed.
They felt that I was unnatural....</p>

<p>“There was one high day in that little upper
room. It was all like a prayer, when they would
suffer me to be alone and not wring me with their
misery&mdash;but this one high day, I must tell you. I
stood by the window in the watery light of the
sun from the far north. That moment the Strange
Courage came. I felt that I could lead a nation,
not to war, but to enduring peace; as if I had a
message for all my people, and a courage not of
woman’s, to tell it, to tell it again and again&mdash;until
all the people answered. It was then that
I understood that a man’s soul had come to my
baby, and that it was not to be a girl, as I had
sometimes thought.</p>

<p>“And then the rest of the waiting&mdash;days of
misery that I can hardly remember the changes
of&mdash;yet something singing within me&mdash;I holding
it high toward heaven as I could&mdash;singing with
the song within. After weeks, it suddenly came
to me what they wanted to do to hide their shame&mdash;to
take the little child half-finished from me&mdash;to
murder it&mdash;to hide their shame.</p>

<p>“Then I told them that it had not occurred to
me to marry Paul&mdash;that I did not love him&mdash;that
I had loved the little child. I told them that I
did not believe in the world&mdash;that I did not believe
I had done wrong&mdash;that I did not believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>our old preacher who stayed so long at the table
could make me more ready for the child. I told
my father that I did not believe in marrying a
man and saying that I would have no children for
three years. I told him that I was mad for the
child&mdash;that I was young and strong and ready to
die for it ... that my baby wanted me, and no
other. I would have gone away, but they would
not let me do that. They kept me in an upper
room. Paul had gone away ... and after
months my father went to find him. It was sad
to me&mdash;sadness that I cannot forget in that&mdash;my
father taking his cane and his bag and setting
out to find the father&mdash;heart-broken and full of
the awfulness of being away from his home. He
had not been away for years.... And my
mother coming timidly to my room.... And
then I went down like Pharaoh’s daughter to the
very edge of the water&mdash;for, for the Gleam!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were shining and she laughed a little,
looking upward as if she saw a vision of it, and
had forgotten the room and the listening&mdash;her
eyes as close to tears as laughter.</p>

<p>“... And when I came back&mdash;it was all so
different. I could pity them&mdash;my heart breaking
for my father and mother, who had not the
wonder, and only the fears. They were passing
out&mdash;after doing their best as they saw it, for
many, many years together&mdash;and I had brought
them the tragedy, the crumbling of their house&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
shame upon the patriarch of the long road, a
blackness upon her maternities.... It was my
father’s thought to bring Paul to me. As if I
would have taken him, but he came&mdash;my father
having given him much money.... Oh, do not
be hard upon him. There is wildness in him and
looseness, but the world had showed him the way
and he was young. I said to him (it was within
ten days after the coming and my father and
mother were gone from the room), ‘I would not
think of marrying you, Paul, but do not tell them.
As soon as I am ready, I shall go away with you,
and they will not be so unhappy&mdash;and as soon as
we are well away, you shall be free. And you
may keep the money, Paul.’</p>

<p>“... And now it is like bringing you a reward
for listening so well. I tell you now of a moment
of beauty and wonder&mdash;such as I had known but
once before, and was more real to me than all
the rest. It made that which was sorrowful and
sordid of the rest seem of little account.... It
was early evening in the upper room and still
light. An old servant who loved me was in the
room, and the Gleam was sleeping&mdash;the fourteenth
day after his coming. The woman helped
me to a chair and drew it to the window, and
all was hushed. Even before I looked out, an
unspeakable happiness began to gush into my
heart.</p>

<p>“The ravine was crowding with darkness, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>the long road was full of light. The houses between
seemed to dwindle but the distance was
full of radiance&mdash;that perfect afterglow again.
Not for twenty years had there been such a sunset,
and now the sky was massed with gold of the
purple martin’s breast, and the roof of Paul’s
house was like two open leaves of beaten gold&mdash;everywhere
the air filled with strange brightenings.
The fragrance from the fields arose to meet
the heaven falling from the sky.</p>

<p>“I tried to make believe, but the road was
empty. The Guest would never come again, and
yet on such a night as this, he had come to me&mdash;like
a saint that has finished his work, like a
Master coming down a last time. All the room
and the house was hushed behind me.... But
the long road was empty.</p>

<p>“The old servant at last could bear it no longer.
Perhaps she thought I did not breathe. Softly
she crossed the room to the cradle, lifted the
Gleam and placed him in my lap&mdash;as if to call
me back. Breath came quickly at the touch of
him, and she must have heard a low, joyous sound
as I felt the child. With one hand I held him,
patting his shoulder softly, slowly, with the other,
until the ecstasy of long ago flowed into my being.</p>

<p>“There was a moment that I should have asked
her to take the Gleam from me&mdash;had I been able
to speak. It was such a moment that I had run
out under the stars. But as I patted the tiny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>shoulder, the burden of the ecstasy passed, and
a durable blessedness came&mdash;the calm of great
understanding.</p>

<p>“The road&mdash;of course it was empty&mdash;for he
had come.... I thought I had told the old
servant, but a second time I seemed to see her
anxious face bending so near in the dusk.</p>

<p>“‘Why, don’t you see?’ I whispered. ‘He was
looking for his mother when I found him.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was the end of the story&mdash;the rest just
details that an outsider might ask: How she went
away with Paul for the sake of her father; how
he remained with her during the long voyage to
America, but as nothing to her, more and more
a stranger of different ways from hers&mdash;how he
gave her but a little of the money her father had
put in trust for her keeping&mdash;and rushed away to
dig his grave in the city.... Then just a
glimpse of her need and her labour and longing
for the Island life&mdash;a dream, the <i>Jade</i>....</p>

<p class="center no-indent">5</p>

<p class="no-indent">The final morning, Bellair took the babe in his
arms and let himself down the rocky way to the
shore. The trail was empty behind him, and
the cottage shut off by the group of little
pines, pure to pass through as the room of a child.
And here were rain-washed boulders warming in
the morning sun, and before his eyes the blue
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>and deep-eyed sea. It rolled up to his feet, forever
changing with its stories and its secrets, very
cool about them all to-day, full of mastery and
leisure.</p>

<p>Bellair sat upon a stone and looked at the child:
“I wish you could tell me, little man ... but
you are not telling. You know it all, like the
sea&mdash;but you do not tell.... And I’ll see you
so many times, when I’m away,&mdash;see you like this
and wish many times I could hold you. For we
were always friends, good friends. You didn’t
ask much.... And you were fine in the pinch,
my son.... That little cry I heard, that little
cry.... He loved you, and promised great
things for you. I’ve come to believe it, little man,
for I know your mother. That’s good gambling,
from where I stand.... He knew it first. He
knew it all first. And you didn’t tell him....
Oh, be all to her, little Gleam&mdash;be all to her, and
tell her I love her&mdash;when she looks away to the
sea. Tell her, I’ll be coming, perhaps.... I
didn’t know I’d ever be called to kiss a little boy&mdash;but
it’s all the same to you ... and take care
of her for me.”</p>

<p>They were standing together a last time before
his journey. The carriage had been waiting many
minutes. The child was propped upon the lawn,
and Elsie was picking her steps and shaking her
paws that met the dew under the grass. His eye
was held over her shoulder to the weathered door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>of the stone cottage. It was ajar and coppery
brown, like the walls above the young vines. And
over her other shoulder, too, was the brilliant
etheric divide of the sea. He had to go back and
stand a moment in the large room. The wind and
the light came in; the vine tendrils came trailing
in. He saw her books, her pictures, her chair,
her door....</p>

<p>He stood beside her again, and tried to tell her
how moving these weeks had been.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have seen both sides, and this was
the perfect side. We saw the other, well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you are not caught in either&mdash;that’s what
thrills me most,” said he. “I am always caught&mdash;in
hunger and thirst and fear and pain&mdash;in
beauty and possessions. But you have stood the
same through it all&mdash;ready to come or go, ready
for sun or storm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“After years of changes and uncertainty, one
comes to rely only upon the true things.”</p>

<p>“I shall want to come back&mdash;before the first
turn of the road,” he said. “I think I am hungry
for the little house now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She put her arms about him. His heart was
torn, but there was something immortal in the
moment.</p>

<p>“This shall always be your home,” she said.
“You may come back to-night&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;in
twenty years&mdash;this is your house. I shall be here.
I shall teach <i>him</i> to know and welcome you....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>We are different. We are not strangers. We
have gone down into the deep ways together. We
shall always know each other, as no one else can,
or as we can know no others. So we must be
much to each other&mdash;and this is our home. You
will never forget.... Oh, yes, you must come
back&mdash;just as you must go away&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sentence by sentence, softly, easily spoken; not
with a great beauty of saying, but with a bestowal
of the heart that compelled his finest receptivity.
And she had held him as a mother might, or as
a sister, or as a woman who loved him. There
was something in her tenure, of all the loves of
earth. He looked deeply into her eyes, but hers
was the love that did not betray itself then in
the senses. He could not know, for he would not
trust his own heart.... But this he knew, and
was much to ponder afterward: This which she
gave, could not have been given, nor have been
received, before the days of the open boat. So
strange was the ministry of that fasting.</p>

<p>They kissed, and hers so gladly given, failed
of the secret; yet revealed to him a love that sustained,
and sent him forth a man&mdash;such as Bellair
had not been.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ellair</span> reached New York on a mid-May
morning from the west, and
walked up Seventh avenue to his old
room. It was a time of day that he
had seldom known the street and step. There
was a different expression of daylight upon them.
Of course, he had met these matters on many Sundays,
but Sunday light and atmosphere was invariably
different to his eyes&mdash;something foreign
and false about it. He saw the old hall-mark,
however, in the vestibule&mdash;the partial sweeping....
It had always been her way; all things a
form. The vestibule and stone steps had to be
swept&mdash;that was the law; to be swept with
strength and thoroughness was secondary. He
rang, and asked the servant for the woman of
the house.</p>

<p>Waiting, he found himself in a singular depression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
of mind. The City had cramped and bewildered
him. A small oval of grey-white cloud
appeared in the dark hall. It came nearer, and
Bellair saw the face of dusty wax&mdash;smaller, a
little lower from his eyes. It came very near,
and was upturned. The vision was dim, and the
memory; all the passages slow and cluttered.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Bellair,” she said, without offering
her hand.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve come back.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a room&mdash;for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“And about your things in storage&mdash;I would be
glad for the space now. Could you take care of
this to-day?’</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I have the bill ready.”... She called the
servant who came with the broom. “On my table
among the papers you will find Mr. Bellair’s bill
for storage. Please get it.”</p>

<p>Bellair heard the servant on the stairs, one, two,
three flights; then a long silence. He had never
been quite sure where the landlady slept, believing
that she hovered from basement to sky-light according
to the ebb and flow of the tenant tides.
The double-doors from the hall to the lower front
room were slightly ajar. This, the most expensive
in the house, appeared to be vacant. The servant
was gone a long time. The landlady did not leave
him alone in the hall. They did not speak. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>darkness crept upon Bellair as if he were in a
tank that was slowly but surely being filled, and
presently would cover him. The paper was
brought, the charge for six months’ storage,
meagre. Bellair paid it, and offered more. He
thought of her hard life, but the extra money was
passed back to him.</p>

<p>“I have that present in keeping,” she said.</p>

<p>“What present?”</p>

<p>“That you gave me the night you went
away&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I gave it to you. Would you not take
a little gift from one who had been in your house
five years?”</p>

<p>“Money easily got, goes the same,” she answered.</p>

<p>Then Bellair realised how stupid he had been.
She had seen the newspapers. She had been
afraid to trust him alone in that bare hall. The
smell of carpets stifled him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you feel that way,” he said. “But
hold the present a little longer. Perhaps you will
not always feel that it came so easily. I’ll send
for my goods at once.... Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Bellair.”</p>

<p>He was ill. The side-door of a famous hotel
yawned to him directly across the street from his
step. He was not sure they would take him.
Registering, he stopped to think where he was
from, adding Auckland, N. Z.... Yes, his bags
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>would be brought from the station. They
gave him a room, and Bellair stood in the centre
of it.</p>

<p>For a few moments he actually weakened&mdash;limbs
and mind. It wasn’t New York alone, nor
the sordid incident across the street, reminding
him so ruthlessly of Lot &amp; Company and all that
had been and was still to do; rather it was a giving
way to a loneliness that had been rising for
almost a month, wearing him to a shadow of himself,
and giving him battle night and morning.
Like many another solitary young man, he had
brooded much upon what a certain woman might
be. He had found that in those women he met,
certain spaces must be filled in by his own compassion&mdash;and
these spaces did not endure. Always
in a test they separated from the reality.
But the Faraway Woman day by day had fulfilled;
even where his idealism failed, she completed
the picture of the woman above him and
of irresistible attraction.</p>

<p>She had come nearer and nearer. She was
magic in this way. He had regarded her at first
distantly and askance at the rail of the <i>Jade</i>. A
gasp now came from him. That was so impossible
and long ago.... She had not called him any
more than a peasant woman. And yet one after
another her rarities had unfolded; it would always
be so. She was the very fountain of romance to
him; the essence of whose attraction is variableness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>of days. Of all the days together, there had been
no two alike&mdash;no two hours alike. He had
watched her face under the light&mdash;never twice the
same. The child, the maiden, the mother, the
love-woman, the saint&mdash;lips passional, devotional
... then those wonder-moments when the old
tragedies came back to her eyes.</p>

<p>They stirred him as if he had known her long
ago; and yet nothing of this had come to him at
first. How crude and coarse he had been not to
see. Lot &amp; Company and New York had covered
her from his eyes. He had to fast and pray
and concentrate upon her being, as a devotee upon
the ball of crystal to begin upon her mysteries.
Every man has his Lot &amp; Company, his New York&mdash;the
forces that bind him to the world. A man
bound to the world can see but the body of a thing&mdash;the
paint of a picture, just the outline and pigment
of a picture or a bit of nature&mdash;just the body
of a woman.</p>

<p>Something came to him that instant&mdash;of the
perfect law of all things. Those caught in the
body of events see but that, hear but that, anticipate
but that&mdash;the very secret of all the misery
and shortsightedness in the world. A man must
rise, lift the centre of consciousness above the body
of things, even to see physical matters in their true
relation. It was all so thrillingly true to him in
this glimpse&mdash;that a man can never see properly
the sequence of his actions unless he can rise above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>them&mdash;that those in the ruck never know what
they are about....</p>

<p>He tried to remember her face, as he stood in
the hotel room. Failing, his mind returned to
their days together. He was apart now and could
view them, one by one, in their wonder and beauty.
He was torn with them. At different times on
the long voyage he had dwelt separately upon the
episodes. Some had worn him to exhaustion.
People on the ship had believed him a man with
a great grief. At first, he looked about from face
to face searching for some one whom he might
tell, but there was no reception for his story. He
had to stop and think that he was different and
apart.... She had always been apart.</p>

<p>He had carried it alone, moving hushed and
alone with his story; lying open-eyed in his berth
through the hours of night, and often through the
afternoons, an open book face downward upon his
chest, his pipe cold ... living again the different
moments in the rooms of the stone cottage, in the
garden, on the shore; their journeys together, their
breakfasts and luncheons and evenings together.</p>

<p>The boy was gone from him, from face and
body. He did not know what had come instead,
but he knew that he carried a creative image in his
heart; something of the fragrance of her lingering
about him. It had come to him at night alone
on deck&mdash;the sweetness of her&mdash;on the wind. All
that he wanted, all that he dreamed best of life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>and labour and love ... and yet after all, what
had he to do with her in relation to these intimate
things? Friend, companion, confidante&mdash;she was
everything that a woman could be, except&mdash;&mdash; Had
not the substance of that kind of giving died
for her in the passing of the preacher?...
Something of her story frightened him. She had
learned the ultimate realness of loving. The man
who entered her heart now would have to come
with an immortal seal upon him. There was but
one who could take up the fatherhood of the
Gleam.... Bellair did not feel the man; did
not know what she had given him; did not know
what had come to him&mdash;to his face and carriage
and voice. He had not yet lifted himself above
so that he could see. Those whom he met, however,
were struck with a different Bellair, and
those who could not understand thought him
touched a little queerly&mdash;as a man after sunstroke
or any great light.</p>

<p>... It was now noon. He thought of his old
friend, Broadwell, of the advertising-desk at Lot
&amp; Company. Perhaps Broadwell would dine
with him. He called. The voice came back to
him.... Yes, he would come at once. Bellair
asked him to the hotel. In the interval he called
the Trust company in whose keeping the thousand
dollar surety had been, inquiring if Lot &amp; Company
had collected the amount. The answer was
returned presently to the effect that Lot &amp; Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
had presented his release and collected the
amount with interest four days after his departure.</p>

<p>Bellair hearkened to a faint singing somewhere
within and found it had to do with Bessie. He
called Brandt’s and ascertained that the same
quartette was to sing there at nine in the evening.
This was also one of the things he had come to
do.</p>

<p>Broadwell was a trifle late, but all urbanity.
There was something of the salesman’s manner
and enunciation about him. Bellair fell away
after the greeting, caught in a sort of mental
flurry in which the picture of another luncheon
engagement recurred to his mind&mdash;the day he
had passed the desk and cage of Mr. Sproxley
with the stranger named Filbrick, and his own
telling of the cashier’s passionate honour....
When he came back to see clearly the face of
Broadwell, he found that he personally was being
scrutinised with odd intensity. Could it be that
Broadwell had something more than a personal
friendly interest? His questions did not seem
adroit, and yet he wanted to know so much&mdash;of
the ship, of Auckland, but especially of this long
drive back to New York.</p>

<p>“Are you stopping here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. My old room was just opposite, but I
was told that the house was full.”</p>

<p>“So you came here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to stay in New York?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ben. There are a few things
to see to.”</p>

<p>“Are you looking for a job?”</p>

<p>“Well, no. Not exactly, at least.”</p>

<p>Try as he might, Bellair could not feel free, as
of old time. He felt the other wanted something,
and this checked his every offering. He knew
that Broadwell, at least six months before, could
not have believed ill of Lot &amp; Company, and
there was no apparent change. The disclosure
of the press must have righted itself in the office
so far as he, Bellair, was concerned; surely Broadwell
did not share the dread of him the landlady
had shown; and yet, it was hard to broach these
things. The advertising-man apparently had no
intention of doing so.</p>

<p>“We’ve all missed you on the lower floor,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Are there any changes?”</p>

<p>“Very few.”</p>

<p>“Who took my place?”</p>

<p>“Man from outside. Mr. Rawter brought in
the man&mdash;middle-aged. Mr. Sproxley knew him,
too.”</p>

<p>“Poor devil,” said Bellair, but not audibly.
They had not dared to open the ledger revelations
to any one in the office, but had found a
man outside who was doubtless familiar with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>such books, doubtless one who had been deformed
in the long, slow twistings of trade. Perhaps this
one had children. Children were good for Lot
&amp; Company’s most trusted servants. It was well
to have a number of children, like Mr. Sproxley&mdash;for
their wants are many, and a man’s soul cannot
breathe in the midst of many wants and small
salary.</p>

<p>“Are you coming over to the office?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I find I have to. Some folks are taking
the end Lot and Company gave the newspapers
about my leaving. They were very much in a
hurry about giving out that newspaper story&mdash;with
the money in the vaults.”</p>

<p>Broadwell regarded him seriously. “I suppose
they took the point of view that there could be
but one motive for your leaving, without giving
notice. Most firms would&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wonder if most firms would?” Bellair asked.
“Men have lapses other than falling into thievery.
At least a firm should look up the facts in the case
first. It’s a rather serious thing to charge a man
with departure with funds. For instance, the
public will glance through the details of such a
charge, and miss entirely a denial afterward. Are
you under bond?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t handle company funds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Suppose you were&mdash;and one night you came to
the end of your rope&mdash;found you couldn’t go
back&mdash;found it was a life or death matter of your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>soul, whether you went back or not. Still you
had some salary coming and say a thousand dollars’
surety. You took this amount exactly&mdash;salary
and bond and interest to the dollar, and
left a note saying so, in place of the amount; also
a note releasing to your firm the amount of the
bond and interest, and stating clearly the item of
salary&mdash;I say, would you expect to find yourself
charged with embezzlement in next day’s
paper?”</p>

<p>Broadwell’s shoulders straightened.</p>

<p>“Not in next day’s paper,” he said, with a
smile.</p>

<p>Bellair did not miss the cut of this.</p>

<p>“You think that my case was not like that
exactly?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why a firm would give such a story
to the press&mdash;unless they uncovered a loss,”
Broadwell said slowly.</p>

<p>“Lot &amp; Company couldn’t have uncovered a
loss without looking in the very place where my
note was, which proved there was no loss. Lot
&amp; Company couldn’t have collected my bond
without proceedings&mdash;unless they found my release
of it. And the bond was collected.”</p>

<p>“Then I can’t see any reason for incriminating&mdash;any
one,” said Broadwell.</p>

<p>“Well, there was a reason&mdash;though the facts
of my case are exactly as stated. Lot &amp; Company
had a reason. I haven’t decided whether it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>will be necessary to make that known.... But
I didn’t bring you here to discuss this affair. I
wanted to see <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Broadwell was paged. A messenger
was said to be waiting for him in the
lobby.</p>

<p>“Send him in,” Broadwell said thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>Davy Acton came, and Broadwell saw his error.
Bellair perceived that his luncheon-companion had
made known his engagement at the office before
leaving....</p>

<p>“Sit down, Davy. I’m glad to see you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The boy had grown. Bellair noted that simple
thing, as he noted the fact also that Davy was
tortured with embarrassment, and had not meant
to come in. He wriggled his hand forward to
take Bellair’s, which was held toward his, and
then looked down shamefacedly, as if <i>he</i> had been
charged with theft. Bellair knew well that the
boy’s trouble was how to meet him&mdash;formerly a
friend, but now an outcast from the firm. A kind
of darkness stole over him. He saw now that
Broadwell believed him a thief, even as the landlady
had believed; but in the case of neither of
these did the dread finality come to him, as from
the face of this stricken boy.</p>

<p>This was the thought that shot through Bellair’s
mind, “No one liked Davy so well as I
did; no one tried to help him as I did; and now
he thinks my liking and my helping, a part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>the looseness of character which made me a
thief.”</p>

<p>The thought was strange, yet natural, too. It
came into the darkness which had covered the
abode of Bellair’s consciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“A bit of copy&mdash;that I missed getting off,”
Broadwell was saying. “I was excited when you
called.... All right, Davy. I’ve told ’em
where to find it on the back of the note.... And
now Bellair&mdash;you were saying&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair watched for the turn on the part of Broadwell
that would reveal the character of his message,
for he did not believe the matter of the copy
for the printer. The chill was thick between
them, yet Bellair managed to say:</p>

<p>“I’m not here for reprisal or trouble-making.
It’s rather a novelty to be innocent, yet charged
with a thing; certainly one sees a look from the
world that could come no other way. I want to
see you again&mdash;soon. I’ve got a story to tell you.
It was a big thing to me. We used to have things
in common. I’d like to tell you the story and see
how it strikes you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good. I’m to spare&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Suppose you come here to lunch to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, you come with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“I’d prefer it the other way,” Bellair declared.
“It’s my story you are to listen to.”</p>

<p>As they parted, there was just a trace of the
old Broadwell, that left Bellair with a feeling
of kindness.</p>

<p>“I’m interested to hear that story,” the advertising-man
said. “It did something to you apparently.
Pulled you down a lot&mdash;but that’s not
all. I can’t make it out exactly&mdash;but you’ve got
something, Bellair.”</p>

<p>That was a long afternoon.... He had been
gone less than six months; and yet was as much
a stranger, as a young man coming in from the
West for the first time. The hours dragged. The
City did not awe him, but so much of it struck him
in places tender. He could give and give; there
seemed no other way, no other thing to do. He
sat on a bench in Union Square, and talked with
an old man who needed money so badly that Bellair
reflected for some time the best way to bestow
it without shock. The old fellow looked so near
gone, that one feared his heart would break under
any undue pressure of excitement.</p>

<p>Bellair concluded he had better buy a stimulant
first of all, so he led the way across the Square to
Kiltie’s. They lined up against the bar, and
warmed themselves, the idea in Bellair’s mind
being to give something beside money. Now the
old man (not in the least understanding more
than it was the whim of the stranger to do something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
for him), was so intent on what was to be
done that he could not listen. Bellair had to come
to the point. They went to a table for a bite of
lunch, and the spectacle of a beggar’s mind opened&mdash;a
story lacking imagination and told with the
pitiful endeavour to fit into what was imagined to
be the particular weakness of this listener.</p>

<p>For months, Bellair had not touched the little
orbit of the trodden lives. The story was not
true, for no single group of ten words hinged upon
what had been said, or folded into the next statement.
The old man was not simple, but his guile
was simple, and the simplicity of that was obscene.
Begging might be a fine art, but men chose or
fell into their work without thought of making
an art of it. The old man did not know his own
tremendous drama. Had he dared plainly to be
true, he would have captivated the world with his
own poor faculties. Behind the affectations were
glimpses of great realities&mdash;if only the fallen
mind could accept his days and tell them as they
came&mdash;just the imperishable fruits of his days.
As it was, the whiskey swept them farther away,
and the creature attempted to act; his pitiful conception
of effects were called into being. The
throb of it all was the way the world was brought
back to Bellair. His whole past city life thronged
into mind. This was but a shocking example of
myriads of lives&mdash;trying to be what their undeveloped
senses prompted for the moment, rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>than to be themselves. This was the salesman’s
voice and manner, he had seen in Broadwell....
He stopped his revery by handing over the
present.</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes were wild now with hope
and anguish to get away; a mingling of fear, too,
lest the great sum of money in one piece be counterfeit;
lest the stranger ask it back, or some one
knock him down and take it away.</p>

<p>“I sat in a small boat,” Bellair was saying, “for
ten days, with very little food and water. I saw
one man die like a beast of thirst&mdash;or fear of
thirst; and I saw another man master it&mdash;so that
he died smiling&mdash;as only a man can die&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair did not finish. He had tried to catch
the old man’s attention with this&mdash;to hold it an
instant, thinking that some word would get home,
something of the immortal facts in his heart,
something greater than cash ... but the old
man believed him insane, a liar, a fool or all
three.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said, looking to the side, and
to the door.</p>

<p>So he could listen, neither before nor afterward.
Bellair eased his agony by letting him go&mdash;the
money gripped in his hands, his limbs hastening,
eyes darting to the right and left, as he sped
through the swinging door.... For several
moments, Bellair sat in the sorrow of it&mdash;lost in
the grimmest of all tragedies&mdash;that here we are, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>human family, all designed for lofty and majestic
ends, yet having lost the power to articulate to
each other. Suddenly Bellair remembered that
the old face had looked into his for a swift second,
when he was released&mdash;shaken, ashen, a murmur
of something like “God thank you,” on the trembling
lips. There was a bit of a ray in that....
Then he settled back into the tragedy again. It
was this&mdash;that the old man had thought him insane
for trying to help him; that he had seen
something foreign and altogether amiss in the
landlady’s eyes, in Ben Broadwell’s, and what
was more touching to him, in Davy Acton’s.</p>

<p>Bellair straightened his shoulders. The misery
of the thing oppressed him until he brought it to
the laugh. Formerly he would have tried to
escape. It was not his business if the old man
would not be helped; he had tried. If a man
can succeed in radiating good feelings and a spirit
of helpfulness, he has done his part; the consequences
are out of his hand. He saw that he had
wanted to help; that what he had taken from the
open boat and from the woman had brought this
impulse to the fore in all his thinking. After that
he must be an artist in the work; must become
consummate; but having done his best&mdash;he must
not spend energy in moods and personal depressions....
As for Lot &amp; Company, he must meet
them on their own footings&mdash;forgetting everything
but their points of view. It was his business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
now to make a black spot clean, and it was
an ugly material matter to be coped with as such,
calling forth will-power and acumen of a world
kind. He would see if he was to fail.</p>

<p>Bellair’s laugh was hard at first, from the
tensity of the temptation to give up and let New
York have its way in his case. Having whipped
that (and it was a fair afternoon’s work) the
smile softened a little, and he entered upon the
task of the evening.</p>

<p>... Brandt’s was just as he had left it. The
crowd increased; the quartette came. Bessie was
lovely as ever; slightly different, since he had
thought of her so much in the old hat. She did
not see him, but her smile was like a flower of
warmth and culture. A touch of the old excitement
mounted in his breast, as they sang....
This was New York&mdash;among men&mdash;food and
drink and warmth. This, too, was life; these
were men who toil every day, who cannot take
months to dream in, who cannot cross the sea and
observe heroes and saints, but men who crowd
and toil and fight, even expire, for their pleasures&mdash;such
were the surgings of Bellair’s brain in
the midst of the music. Bessie was the arch of
it all&mdash;the arch of the old home, New York,&mdash;not
this Bessie, but the Bessie that might be, the
significant woman it was his work to make and
mould. He was living his own thoughts, as much
as listening. They vanished when the music
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>stopped.... He sent a waiter to her with this
written on a blank card:</p>

<p>“Will you sing <i>Maying</i> for an old friend?”</p>

<p>... The song choked the wanderer, and this
was the new mystery of <i>Maying</i>&mdash;that it left him
at the stone gate of a door-yard beyond windy
Auckland....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He sent forward a gift of flowers, and was in
a daze when she came to him and sat down.</p>

<p>“I have only a few minutes. We sing once
more and then go. How dark and thin you look!”</p>

<p>He wanted to see her after her work was done,
but dared not ask until other things were said....
There were words that left no impress, until
he heard himself saying:</p>

<p>“I read the New York papers at sea&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“... The reporters came to me. I had told
some one of seeing you. It was just after I had
read the news. It was new to me to have reporters
come&mdash;and somehow they got what they
wanted&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, that didn’t matter. Only it was all unnecessary.
My accounts there were never other
than straight.”</p>

<p>She said she was glad. He saw she was more
glad to drop the subject, and didn’t exactly believe
him.</p>

<p>“And you’ve had luck away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in several ways&mdash;beside money.”</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>It seemed necessary to add the last. He was
struck with the shame and pity of it; yet it had
to do with seeing her again.</p>

<p>“Are you going to be in New York long?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’d like to talk with you to-night,
after you are through. I might know better
then&mdash;how long I am to stay.... Is it
possible?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“After the <i>Castle</i>”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be given a chance&mdash;in two weeks&mdash;a
real chance,” she declared. “I’ll tell you
later.”</p>

<p>He tried to make himself believe that it was
just as it had been; that Bessie was the same, the
meaning of New York and the fortune that had
come to him. How could she sing so, if it were
not true?</p>

<p>“The formal try-out is two weeks from to-day,”
she added. “The rest is done. It’s the chance
for life&mdash;one of the leads with the <i>King Follies</i>
for next season. They’ve already heard me. I
need to do no more, than has been done?”</p>

<p>“Just singing?”</p>

<p>“There are many lines and some dancing&mdash;oh,
it’s a chance to storm the piece&mdash;if I can.”</p>

<p>She enlarged and detailed the promise; Bellair
forgot many things he had to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“Is that all you want, Bessie?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“This chance.”</p>

<p>Her brows knit with irritation. It was her high
tide, and he did not seem able to rise with it.
Still she dared not be angry with him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see&mdash;it’s everything?”</p>

<p>“A good salary, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you are all fixed for it?”</p>

<p>“All but clothes&mdash;the old struggle. You helped
me wonderfully before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could help you again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, could you?” She was joyousness aflame&mdash;her
whole nature winging about him.</p>

<p>Deep within, he was empty and bleak and cold.
He wanted to give her money, but somehow could
not make it easy for her. It cheapened him in
his own eyes.... He was silent&mdash;his thoughts
having crossed the world. There is no one to explain
the sentence that ran through his mind,
“... <i>who buys wine for the Japanese girls in
Dunedin, since Norcross was conscripted in the
service we all shall know?</i>”</p>

<p>“... But what am I to do for you,” he heard
the girl inquire, “since you are&mdash;not going away
to-night?”</p>

<p>He quaked at the old recall. Perhaps he had
forgotten a little how to be sharp and city-wise;
at least, he did not make himself clear at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“You have your mornings, don’t you, Bessie?”</p>

<p>“Not if I’m to have new clothes. That’s morning
work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s so much to say. I’ve thought about
you in a lot of strange places&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She leaned forward and said with a pitiful
quiet, “Once, you only wanted me to be good.”</p>

<p>Then it dawned on him. “Good God, Bessie,”
he cried, “I don’t want you to be bad!”</p>

<p>She regarded him, playing with the stem of her
glass, as of old time. A curious being he was to
her, and quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>“You love me?” she asked.</p>

<p>The bass now beckoned, and she fled.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair saw that one may have a gift from heaven,
a superb singing-voice, for instance, but that one
must also furnish the thought behind it. It was
not that Bessie Brealt lacked ambition; in fact, she
had plenty of that, but it was the sort that cannot
wait for real results. She did not see the great
singer; she had not a thought to give with her song.
She had not the emotions upon which a great organ
of inspiration might be built with the years.
Already she was touched with the world; the
world stirred her desires; matters of first importance
in her mind were the things she wanted.</p>

<p>She was not different from the thousands, from
the millions, in this. He had not altogether lost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>the conviction that she might be made different.
Already she was singing too much; her voice
would never reach its full measure under these
conditions. She would suffer the fate of the
countless high-bred colts that are ruined by being
raced too young, being denied the right to sound
maturity. She should have been out of the life-struggle
for years yet; in the country, in the perfect
convent of natural life. She had not answered
the true call, but meanwhile a call had
come; its poison had entered. Bellair saw that
the process before him, if any, was to break before
building.... If consummate art were used, might
not Bessie be helped to conceive the great career?
Of course that thought must come first. However,
he was far from believing that any art of
his could be consummate.... Speaking that
night of her new opportunity, he said:</p>

<p>“They will rehearse you a great deal&mdash;then performances
twice a day&mdash;and you’re not more than
twenty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just twenty&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You should be forty&mdash;before giving your
voice so much work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Forty, I will doubtless be finished.
Forty, and before, the fat comes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“People can forget fat&mdash;when a great voice is
singing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The great voices have sung from children,”
she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>He believed this untrue; at least, he believed
that with conservation, a more sumptuous power
was attainable. “They have sung naturally perhaps,
but not professionally. If they were called
into the stress of life very young, any greatness
afterward was in spite of the early struggle, not
because of it. The voice is an organ that wears
out. It is not the same as the character which
improves through every test. If you were to
spend ten years in study&mdash;ten years, not alone in
vocal culture, but in life preparation and the culture
of happiness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would have me give up this
chance with the <i>Follies</i>?” she asked with the control
that suggests imminent fracture.</p>

<p>“Yes. There is nothing that passes so quickly&mdash;as
the voice of a season. It is the plaything of
a people without memory. If you had ever listened
to the best of the light opera singers, in
contrast to a really developed talent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But this was not the way. Bellair finished the
sentence vaguely, not with the sharpness of the
idea that had come to him. She was nervous and
irritable and tired. She was enduring him, much
as one endures a brother from the country, for
whom allowances must be made; also there was
a deeper reason.</p>

<p>“Perhaps what I think of you,” he said, stirring
to thrill her some way if possible, “is really
a fiery thing, Bessie. I think of you singing great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>hordes of creatures into unity of idea that would
lift them from beasts into men. The world is so
full of sorrow and dulness of seeing; the world is in
a cloud&mdash;I want you to sing the clouds away. If
you could wait&mdash;just wait, as one holding a sure
and perfect gift&mdash;until the real call comes to you,
and then sing, knowing your part, not in pleasure
and amusement, but in life, in the stirring centres
of struggle and strife. If you would go forth
singing that great song of yours&mdash;from your soul!
It would be like a voice from the East&mdash;to bring
the tatters of humanity together. I felt all this
vaguely when I first heard you&mdash;six months ago.
I have thought of it nights and days on the ocean&mdash;in
times when we had to live on our thoughts,
hold fast to them or go mad, for we had two days’
water for ten, and two days’ food for ten. Then
I remembered how I came into Brandt’s, torn that
night, not knowing what to do&mdash;dull-eyed and
covered with wrongs. You sang me free. For
the minute you sang me out of all that. I could
not have freed myself perhaps&mdash;without that
song. I know that there are thousands of men
like me to be freed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair felt on sure ground now. This was
his particular manner and message&mdash;the finest
and strangest thing about him&mdash;the fact that had
always appeared, making him different even from
Fleury and the woman,&mdash;the thought that he was
average&mdash;and not more impressionable than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>multitudes. If they could be reached, they would
make the big turn that he had been shoved into.</p>

<p>“... Thousands just as I was that night,
preyed upon by trade, dull-witted with the ways
of trade, the smug, the bleak, the poisonous
tricks of trade, born and bred&mdash;their real life
softened and watered and wasted away ...
thousands who could turn into men at the right
song, the right word. I always thought of you,
Bessie&mdash;as one of the great helpers. If you can
wait, the way will come. I will help you to wait.
I came back to New York to help you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She picked up his glass and smelled it, her eyes
twinkling. “Splendid,” she said, “but are you
quite sure you haven’t a stick in this ginger-ale?”</p>

<p>Bellair leaned back. He hadn’t touched <i>it</i> yet.
Perhaps something would come, better than
words. It was not straight-going&mdash;this work that
he had dreamed; always a shock in bringing down
dreams from Sinai; always something deadly in
meeting the empirical. He smiled. “Just ginger-ale,
Bessie, but you are a stimulant. You are
more beautiful than before. Not quite so girlish,
but there is something new that is very intense
to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She leaned toward him now, very eager.</p>

<p>“I wondered what you would see. The difference
was plain at once in you.... Tell me what
you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“Just between the fold of the eye and the
point of the chin&mdash;&mdash;” he answered....
(Queerly now he imagined himself talking on the
shore to the little Gleam; it gave him just the
touch that helped.) “&mdash;a little straightening of
the oval, and the little puff at the mouth-corners
drawn out. Why, Bessie, it’s just the vanishing
child. And you are taller. I’m almost afraid to
speak&mdash;to try to put it into words, how pretty
you are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was elate and puzzled, too. “Where did
you get anything like that?” she asked. “It’s
what made me remember before. Always when
you get through preaching&mdash;you pay for it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was out before she thought&mdash;yet for
once the exact unerring thing that was in her
mind.</p>

<p>He treasured it; saw that his appeal was certain
this way; that he must be of the world, and
right glib to master her. The way of reality was
slow; he must never fail to pay for preaching....
They laughed, and the weariness went from
her eyes. The bloom of her health was at its
height. Now as Bellair watched her, thinking
of the world-ways, she suddenly swept home to
him&mdash;the old forbidden adventure of her, the
meaning of money and nights, her homelessness,
the city, the song, the price she would pay if he
demanded it.</p>

<p>The thing was upon him before he realised. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>had all been the new Bellair until now. His body
had lain as if in a vault of wax, its essential forces
in suspension. Suddenly without warning, the
wax had melted away. He did not instantly give
battle to the gust of desire&mdash;met it eye-to-eye.
Bellair felt his own will, and knew he would use
it presently. He was rather amazed at the power
of the thing as it struck him, and the nature of
it, so utterly detached from the redolence and
effulgence he had known in the Stone House. This
was not the old Hunting Companion who had
come with garlands; a minkish aborigine, this,
who had come empty-handed, whose hands were
out to be filled.</p>

<p>The meaning of all that Stackhouse had left
in wallets and sea-girt archipelagoes was in this
sullen-eyed entity&mdash;in the <i>O</i> formed of thirsting
lips. Bellair tried to check it before it came&mdash;the
thought that this was peculiarly a New York
manifestation, one destined to be Bessie Brealt’s
familiar in future years.... He did not have
to use his will. He lost himself in thinking of
her plight.</p>

<p>“... Please bring the coffee,” she was saying
to the waiter, her hand lifted, as if she would
touch his sleeve, the familiarity of one who had
sung here many nights. “Yes, he will have coffee.
He is merely away somewhere.... Yes,
we will have it smoked with cognac&mdash;but here&mdash;do
it here. I like to see it burn....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Brealt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The lights had all come back to Bellair. He
was miserable&mdash;the adventure palled. There had
been no lift, nor tumultuous carrying away. The
quick change chilled him. Her words one by one
had chilled him.... At least, he had demanded
a madness to-night. Bessie did not have the wine
of madness in her veins. This much had been
accomplished. He could not break training
coldly.... And now he felt as if the day had
drained him to the heart, as if the day had come
to an end, and he must rest.</p>

<p>He turned to her. “I found a little check-book
for you to-day, but you must go to the bank and
give them your signature. It is made of leather,
small enough for your purse almost. The bank-book
is with it. You will find a little account
started.... And now I will call a cab for
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But your coffee&mdash;&mdash;” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, we will have that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had to get away for a moment. His heart
was desolate with hunger.... The smell of the
kitchen made him think of the galley of a
ship....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Oh, what can I do for you?” Bessie asked,
when he returned.</p>

<p>“It’s what you can do for yourself that interests
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>
<p>“But I must go with the <i>Follies</i>&mdash;if I win. It’s
the career&mdash;the beginning!”</p>

<p>“If you must.”</p>

<p>“And when shall I see you?”</p>

<p>“Here to-morrow night&mdash;if you will.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said eagerly.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">4</p>

<p class="no-indent">On the way to Lot &amp; Company’s the next morning
Bellair smiled at the sense of personal injustice
which had returned to him. He held fast
to a sort of philosophical calm, but permitted his
energy to be excited by a peculiar blending of
contempt and desire to wring the truth from Lot
&amp; Company at any price.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped. Lot &amp; Company was
merely something to master. Lot &amp; Company was
but an organised bit of the world which he had
met; all men had their own organisations to face,
to comprehend the vileness and illusion of, and
then to get underfoot, neck and other vitals....
Bessie had helped him. There was something
in that.... He felt the fighting readiness
within him, and an added warning not to raise
his voice. He must deal with Lot &amp; Company
on the straight low plane of what-was-wanted.
That was the single level of the firm’s understanding.</p>

<p>Davy Acton smiled at him shyly&mdash;the first
face after the pale telephone-miss at the door.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>Davy was more at home in these halls and
floors than in the hotel dining-room. Bellair
heard the jovial voice of Mr. Rawter behind his
partition. From the distance, Broadwell glanced
up and waved at him. Mr. Sproxley’s black eyes
were fixed in his direction from behind the grating
of his cage. Mr. Sproxley came forward, greeted
him and returned. Bellair had asked to see the
elder Mr. Wetherbee, but it appeared that Mr.
Seth was not in.</p>

<p>“I’ll speak with Mr. Nathan Lot,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lot is occupied.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jabez then.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez came forth presently.... He had
been married in the interval, according to Broadwell;
the fact had touched the wide, limp mouth.
A very rich girl had joined pastures with Jabez;
so that this coming forward was one of the richest
young men in New York, representing the fortune
of his mother which the dreaming Nathan had
put into works; representing the fortune he had
recently wedded with or without dreaming, and
also the Lot &amp; Company millions. Mr. Jabez
also stood for the modern note of the firm; he was
designed to bring the old and prosperous conservatism
an additional new and up-to-the-hour
force of suction.... Mr. Jabez smiled.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bellair,” he said with a careless regard,&mdash;doubtless
part of the modern method, the laxity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>of new America which knows no caste. The
thought had formed about him something to this
effect: “What’s the use of me carrying it&mdash;you
will not be able to forget you are talking to forty
millions?”</p>

<p>“Come in,” he added and Bellair followed.</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan was beyond the partition. The
atmosphere of the dreamer had looped over into
the son’s sanctum.... Bellair began at the
point of his handing the letter, addressed to Mr.
Nathan, to the station-porter at the last moment
from the platform of the Savannah Pullman.</p>

<p>“But mails don’t miscarry,” said Mr. Jabez,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact. Perhaps mine wasn’t mailed.
Of course,” he added quietly, “you didn’t require
that letter. You had my note of release in the
safe. They say at the Trust company that you
collected the thousand dollars and interest within
four days after I left.”</p>

<p>“Suppose every employé who has a deposit of
faith&mdash;should tie us up that way?”</p>

<p>“It would be well to find out what he has done&mdash;before
calling in the police.”</p>

<p>“What do you want, Bellair?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez could hold his temper, when its display
was an inconvenience.</p>

<p>“I want a paper signed by you for Lot &amp; Company,
stating that you were in error when you
charged me with absconding with company funds;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>that my accounts were afterward found to be entirely
correct.”</p>

<p>Jabez Lot surveyed him. There was some
change which he did not understand. The paper
asked for, was a mere matter of dictation, a thing
that might be forced from the firm. He believed,
however, that Bellair wanted something else.</p>

<p>“I think the wisest plan for us will be to turn
your case over to our attorney,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why?” Bellair asked. The full episode of
the Nubian File and Mr. Prentidd passed through
his mind.</p>

<p>“You see these affairs are adjusted better out
of the office&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Bellair,” Mr. Jabez said
patiently, “Lot &amp; Company is eager to make
amends for its mistake&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a slow, quiet cough, the most natural
and thoughtless sort of cough from the inner office.
Bellair wondered if the modern method of Mr.
Jabez was wearing a bit upon the dreamer, or if
he were really lost in some inscrutable departure
of mind.</p>

<p>“That would seem natural,” said he. “It
would seem the direct, clear way. I am not
boisterous; I threaten nothing.”</p>

<p>Bellair knew that this reminder of the Prentidd
episode did not help his cause, but he wished
nothing to be lost from the force he possessed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>At the same time, he knew that it was the policy
of Lot &amp; Company to give nothing unforced. He
was interested.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t thought of it, of course,” the future
head now said, “but I have no doubt that
Lot &amp; Company has something as good for you
as your old place, if you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I do not want a position,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>“What is it you want&mdash;again?”</p>

<p>“I want a paper, saying that I stole nothing,
that Lot &amp; Company was in error in charging me
with taking funds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A sort of explanation of our course?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly&mdash;a statement of your course, and
that you incriminated me unjustly&mdash;&mdash;” Bellair
spoke with slow clearness.</p>

<p>“I really believe you had better see Mr. Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because this is most unusual&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Another cough was heard.</p>

<p>“Unusual&mdash;to straighten out a wrong that has
hurt a man?”</p>

<p>“The way you ask it. Lot &amp; Company is willing
to take you back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I do not want to come back. You say
that Lot &amp; Company is eager to make
amends&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Davy Acton came in, saying that Mr. Jabez
was called to the advertising department for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>moment.... To Bellair this was like an interruption
of an interesting story, but he did not
wait long. The scene was merely shifted. He
was in Mr. Nathan’s room. Mr. Rawter joined
them and Mr. Jabez returned directly. The latter
reopened the conversation by relating justly and
patiently what Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why he shouldn’t have such a
paper,” said Mr. Nathan, brushing his fingers
through his hair, as if to force his thoughts down.
He was not a whit older. The same identical
dandruff was upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. Rawter laughed jovially: “Don’t you see?
That’s just it. Individually, that is exactly the
situation&mdash;but a big house&mdash;all its ramifications
affected&mdash;and who’s to be responsible for Lot &amp;
Company as a whole?”</p>

<p>“It was Lot &amp; Company that incriminated me,”
said Bellair.</p>

<p>“I told Mr. Bellair&mdash;&mdash;” Mr. Jabez began.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bellair had better come back to the House&mdash;that
in itself is our acknowledgement,” interrupted
his father. Evidently the son was not
yet finished in training.</p>

<p>Bellair turned to Mr. Jabez, who explained the
point of Bellair’s unwillingness to return. There
was silence at this, as if it were entirely incomprehensible.</p>

<p>“Have you taken a position elsewhere in New
York?” Mr. Nathan asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to?”</p>

<p>“On that&mdash;I cannot be sure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rawter now arose and came forward, placing
his arm across Bellair’s shoulder. The latter
winced, but not physically. For an instant
it had fired and fogged him. “Bellair, my boy,
on the face of it&mdash;this that you ask would seem
very simple,” he began. “I would ask it in your
case, but think of us. By misunderstanding, we
let out the fact that you had gone with funds not
your own.... You were away. We looked for
you everywhere before this happened&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You let it out,” said Bellair. “It is very
simple. Call it in again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so simple.”</p>

<p>“I might come back to work for you,” Bellair
added, “and those who knew would say, ‘He
hadn’t anything. Instead of locking him up, Lot
&amp; Company took him back to work out what he
had taken&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“I might give you a personal letter, saying I
was very sorry, that in the bewilderment of the
moment, we jumped at the conclusion that you
were identified with the missing funds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But the funds were not missing. You could
not look into the vault-box without finding my
letter.”</p>

<p>“Our funds were not all in that box, Bellair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“They would know by next morning, if I had
broken into your bank&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan appeared to be gone from them, his
eyes softened with visions.</p>

<p>“Write him the letter, Mr. Rawter&mdash;&mdash;” suggested
Mr. Jabez.</p>

<p>It struck Bellair like a hated odour&mdash;this tool
for unclean work, Rawter’s part in the establishment.
He did not hasten now, though he knew
they were waiting for his answer. The head of
the sales resumed:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will do this gladly&mdash;in fact, it would
relieve my mind to do this in the most cordial
terms, but I would be interested first in learning
just what disposition of it was intended&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It would be mine,” said Bellair. “Of course,
I should use it as I thought fit.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking&mdash;in adjusting the tone of the
letter, the wording, you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Adjust the tone&mdash;the wording&mdash;to the facts&mdash;that
would seem best. But I would not accept
such a letter from you personally. It would have
to be written for Lot &amp; Company&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan now showed signs of coming back.</p>

<p>“Let us have a day to think it over, Bellair,”
he said.</p>

<p>“In that case&mdash;my part is finished. I have
asked to be lifted out of a shameful position. You
acknowledge that I have this lift coming.” It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>was at this point that an inspiration arrived. “All
that there is left, naturally and equitably, is for
you to do your part. A man’s name is of more
importance than a firm’s name, and in any event,
no man nor firm was ever hurt by squaring a
crooked action.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan appeared to welcome the slight heat
of this remark. It brought the moment nearer
in which hands might be washed and the attorney
summoned. But Bellair was not heated, Mr.
Rawter fumed a little.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by a man’s name being
more important than a firm’s name?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“A firm shares its responsibility. A man shoulders
it alone.”</p>

<p>“And what do you mean by your part being
finished?”</p>

<p>“I have worked in this office five years,” Bellair
answered. “I never saw nor heard of a man in
my position, or in a similar position of asking
something, who profited by allowing delay. I
will put the matter out of mind if the letter is
not furnished to-day. Of course, I expect to get
it. In fact, I have the pressure to force the issue&mdash;although
it seems trivial for me to mention it.”</p>

<p>Bellair had thought of Mr. Prentidd again.
There was doubtless a case of some kind pending
on the matter of the Nubian File. Mr. Prentidd
was no man to stop. It would not have been settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
within six months. Lot &amp; Company knew of
his knowledge of this affair. Bellair plunged:</p>

<p>“In fact, there is a case against Lot &amp; Company,
to which I might add a singular weight of
testimony. As for my own, it would go to the
same counsel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan ruffled his hair and the silent fall
of grey white dust followed. Bellair felt pent.
After so long a time at sea, it was hard for him
to breathe in this place. He wearied now of the
game, although Mr. Nathan was palpably down,
present in the material plane.</p>

<p>“Bellair,” said he, turning about in his chair,
“the added pressure of a discredited employé
doesn’t count for much as testimony in any
case&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I realised at once the reason why you discredited
me&mdash;to cripple for the time being any
knowledge I might care to use against you. However,
you have all granted that I am not discredited.
The only item mentioned in the charge
was the item covered by the Trust company. You
would have to work with Mr. Sproxley to show
a deficit in the books having to do with my departure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bellair,” said Mr. Nathan, “a poor man can
never win a suit against a strongly backed
firm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunately true,” said Bellair, “but
I am not poor. I came into an inheritance during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>the past six months. The fact is, I think I could
spend as much money to buy justice as Lot &amp; Company
would be willing to spend to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Bellair,” said Mr. Nathan, “you will find it
impossible to move the press in your behalf against
the firm of Lot &amp; Company, with our advertising
contracts among the valuable ones in the city
lists&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Knowledge now counted. “You do not advertise
in the <i>Record</i>,” he declared. “I have
often heard from the advertising department that
there is a rupture between this office and that
paper, dating over a quarter of a century&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan touched a button for his stenographer.
She lit upon the little chair beside
him like a winged seed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“To all Parties interested: Mr. Bellair left
our employ suddenly and without furnishing customary
warning,” the president dictated. “Finding
a certain explanation in the vault, instead of
a sum slightly over one thousand dollars belonging
to this firm, we hastily assumed that his sudden
departure was energised by the usual conditions.
In fact, such a suspicion was stated to the press
by this firm. We have since found Mr. Bellair’s
accounts to be correct in every detail, and we furnish
this letter to express in part our concern for
Mr. Bellair’s character which our hasty conclusion
impinged upon. Mr. Bellair left a letter of explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
in the vault, but his action in leaving
abruptly and without explanation forced us on
the spur of the moment to discredit it. However,
the statement of his letter proved true, and the
money taken by Mr. Bellair was the exact amount
of his surety bond, with stipulated interest, and
his salary to the hour of departure.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“You have heard it?” Mr. Nathan inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will do,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>The president nodded to his stenographer, who
whisked out. “It will be ready in a moment,” he
said. “I will sign it for Lot &amp; Company....
Bellair, are you sure you don’t want your old desk
back?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>Mr. Jabez and Mr. Rawter had departed. Bellair
glanced at his watch. It was a moment past
the hour of Mr. Broadwell’s leaving for luncheon.
The advertising-man, of course, was aware of his
presence in the lower office. Bellair stepped out,
however, to make sure of his appointment. Broadwell,
hat in hand, was engaged in talk with Mr.
Jabez. Bellair returned to the office of the president
to wait for the stenographer. Not more than
two minutes later, Davy Acton came in with this
message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mighty sorry to call luncheon off. Am hurrying
to catch a train for Philadelphia for the rest
of the day. Will see you later.&mdash;Broadwell.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>... Bellair folded this thoughtfully. The
stenographer brought the letter with copy. The
front draft was approved for signature, and Bellair’s
morning work accomplished.</p>

<p>In the hall he met Davy Acton, and followed
a quick impulse.</p>

<p>“Davy, lad, how soon will you be ready to go
out to lunch?”</p>

<p>“In about three minutes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for you. I’m going your way.”</p>

<p>Davy’s customary exit was the side-door. Bellair
waited there accordingly. The girls were
coming down the iron stairway from the bindery.
He stepped back in the shadow to let them pass.
There were figures and faces that clutched at his
throat.... And then a story began, half way
up the first flight, and came nearer and nearer, the
voice carrying easily to one who listened with
emotion:</p>

<p>“Did you know that Mr. Bellair was back?...
Bellair, the absconding clerk&mdash;Mr. Sproxley’s
assistant. Lot &amp; Company has refused to
prosecute. He will not be arrested.... And
think of his nerve&mdash;asking his old position
back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>... They saw merely the back of a man, if
they saw him at all. The talk was not interrupted
on the way to the street and beyond.... Bellair
came up with a start to find the boy at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p class="center no-indent">5</p>

<p class="no-indent">For a square or two, Davy Acton walking
beside him, Bellair did not speak. He had
needed that last bit. The morning would have
blurred his hard-earned knowledge of Lot &amp; Company
and the world, without that moment under
the iron stairs. It was hard to take, but a man
mustn’t forget such realities as this. He loses his
grip on the world when he forgets. Happy to
lose, of course, but the point of his effectiveness
is gone when these rock-bottom actualities are forgotten....
He looked down, Davy was hopping
every third step to keep up. Bellair had quickened
his pace to put the stench of the swamp
farther behind him, but it was still in his nostrils....
He laughed.</p>

<p>“I was thinking, Davy, and the thoughts were
like spurs. We’re in no hurry, really.”</p>

<p>He would not take the boy to a stately and
formal dining-room for him to be embarrassed.
Bellair felt that he had something very precious
along; a far graver solution than luncheon with
Broadwell. They sat down at a little table in
the corner of one of the less crowded restaurants.
As they waited, Bellair said, drawing out the
paper he had received from the dreaming Mr.
Nathan:</p>

<p>“I want you to see this first. In fact, I was
particularly concerned about getting it, just to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>show you. Davy, it hit me like a rock&mdash;the way
you looked at me in the hotel yesterday. I
couldn’t have that. We’ve been too good
friends&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Davy read the letter carefully, deep responsibility
upon his understanding.</p>

<p>“Did you have trouble getting it?” he asked
finally.</p>

<p>“It took the forenoon, Davy. I found that they
had not taken the trouble to tell my old friends
on the different floors that I was not a thief. What
was worse for me, they let you think so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t believe it at first,” said Davy.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“I said to Mr. Broadwell, that they’d find out
differently and be sorry. They didn’t let us know
when they found out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s why it was important for me to come
back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But why did you go away like that?”</p>

<p>The boy’s mind dwelt in the fine sense of being
treated as an equal. Bellair felt called upon to be
very explicit and fair:</p>

<p>“I came to the time when I couldn’t live with
myself any longer&mdash;and stay in the cage with Mr.
Sproxley. I saw a ship in the harbour the Sunday
before&mdash;a sailing-ship,” he began, and then made
a picture of it; also of his own hopelessness and
what the years would mean, not touching specific
dishonesties, but suggesting the atmosphere which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>had suddenly become poisonous to him. He did
not forget that Davy had no other place, that he
must keep a certain sense of loyalty, or be destroyed
in such conditions.</p>

<p>“It would have taken two weeks to get clear
in the ordinary way,” he added. “My decision
came the day of the squabble with Mr. Prentidd
in the office. I had to leave right then&mdash;was off
for Savannah that very night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you found the ship there?” Davy asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I beat her there a day and a half. Then we
sailed for South America. I want to tell you the
whole story. This is not the place. Could you
come up in my room after supper to-night?”</p>

<p>“I think my mother will let me come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your mother, Davy. Is she
well? I remember I meant to meet her some
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;just the same. You know she works a
little, too&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where?” Bellair asked absently.</p>

<p>Davy swallowed, and before he spoke, the man
saw with a queer thrill that the boy hadn’t yet
learned to lie.</p>

<p>“Well, she goes out three days a week&mdash;to do
the laundry work&mdash;for people who have had her a
long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>“I’m hoping to get where she won’t have to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>The dinner was brought. Bellair tried to make
up for the place&mdash;in quantity. Neither spoke for
the present. The man was hungry, too.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me that,” he said after a
time, “glad you told me just that way.”</p>

<p>Davy applied himself further. Manifestly here
was a point that he need not follow.</p>

<p>“Davy, you’ll come through. You’re starting
in the right hard way&mdash;the old-fashioned way. It
won’t be so slow as you think&mdash;&mdash;” He was reminded
now of what Fleury had said about the
little Gleam that first night in the open boat.</p>

<p>“Slow but sure at Lot &amp; Company’s&mdash;if a fellow
does his part and works hard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Davy was being brought up in the usual way.</p>

<p>Bellair said: “I’m coming over to see you at
your house some evening soon&mdash;if I may.”</p>

<p>“Sure....  It isn’t much of a house.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so certain about that. Anyway, I
want to come. We’ll talk about it again this
evening. You ask your mother when she’ll let
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You might come to-night&mdash;-instead of me coming
to the hotel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I want to talk with you alone.”</p>

<p>Davy looked relieved.... He was on his way
presently, and the town appeared better to Bellair
that afternoon. At five he was in the hotel-lobby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>when a hand plucked his sleeve and he looked
down into the whitest, most terrified face, he had
ever seen.</p>

<p>“I’m fired!” was the intelligence that came up
from it, and there was reproach, too.</p>

<p>“Come on upstairs, but first take it from me
that you’ll be glad of it, in ten minutes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair had to furnish a swift, heroic antidote
for that agony.</p>

<p>“You haven’t been home, of course?” the man
asked in the elevator.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Could we send a messenger to your mother&mdash;so
she wouldn’t worry, and you wouldn’t have to
go home until after we talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll see to that at once.”</p>

<p>Davy wrote with trembling hands. The messenger
was asked to bring an answer from Mrs.
Acton.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Seth was down when I got back. You
know he only comes down for an hour or two now
in the middle of the day. He called me to him,
and asked where I had been to lunch. I said with
you. That was all, until four o’clock, when Mr.
Eben came to me and asked if you had shown me
anything&mdash;a letter from Lot &amp; Company, for instance.
I said yes. He went away, and at half-past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
four, he called me again, handed me my
weekly envelope, saying that they would not need
me any longer. I came right here. It seemed,
I couldn’t go home&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Davy, lad, I’m glad I’m not broke, but if I
were and couldn’t do a thing to make up&mdash;it
would be a lucky day for you.”</p>

<p>Bellair ordered supper served in the room.
They were free and alone. Faith returned to the
boy, enough for the hour. Davy was consulted
carefully upon the details of the order, a subtle
suggestion from Bellair from time to time. Something
of the long dinners on the <i>Jade</i> had come to
his mind in this rôle. He had learned much about
food that voyage, the profundity and emptiness of
the subject. Bellair told his story, making it very
clear to Davy&mdash;this at first:</p>

<p>“The office was doing to me just what it would
do to you, Davy. It was breaking me down.
The floors of Lot &amp; Company are filled with heart-broken
men. They do not know it well; some of
them could never know, but there are secrets in
the breasts of men there, that you wouldn’t dream
of. It is so all over New York. Trade makes it
so&mdash;offices, the entire city, crowded with heart-broken
men.... They say first, ‘Why, every
one is out for himself and the dollar&mdash;why not
I?’ You and I were taught so in our little schooling.
Then Lot &amp; Company taught us. They are
old masters&mdash;generations of teachers. Cramped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>and bleak, but loyal to the one verb&mdash;<i>get</i>. In all
the Lot family, Davy, there is not a true life principle
such as you brought to the office in the beginning.
But if Lot &amp; Company were unique&mdash;they
would be an interesting study. The city is
crowded with such firms&mdash;heart-breakers of men,
the slow, daily, terrible grind; every movement,
every expression, a lie&mdash;until to those inside, the
lie is reality&mdash;and the truth a forbidden and terrible
stranger. Every man has his Lot &amp;
Company.</p>

<p>“Davy, I breathed a bit of open that Sunday&mdash;so
that I could see, but the next morning it closed
about me again. It was Mr. Prentidd who helped
me out. They stole from him and lied to him.
Face to face, eye to eye, old Seth Wetherbee, the
Quaker, lied to him, taking hundreds of dollars in
the lie&mdash;millionaires taking hundreds of dollars
from a poor inventor. I had the book of the London
transaction before me, which showed the truth
as they talked, and Mr. Sproxley came and took
the book from me, and shut it in the safe....
And then when I left, they knew I had their
secrets. You wondered why they called me a
thief, when I was not. It was plain, Davy, to
spoil anything I might say about their methods.
Instantly they discredited me, because I was one
of six or seven in the office who knew that they
were thieves and liars. And why did they fire you
to-day for lunching with me? Because they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>afraid of what I might have told you. And why
did they send Broadwell to Philadelphia when
they knew he was to have lunch with me? For
fear of what I might tell Broadwell. Even now
they will not tell the different floors that I am
exonerated.... But they are afraid, Davy&mdash;that’s
their hell. That is their life&mdash;fear and the
lie. Imagine men standing straight up to heaven&mdash;spines
lifted from the ground, but going back
to the ground&mdash;who knows but their souls already
belly-down?&mdash;because they break the hearts of
men, and live with fear and the lie.”</p>

<p>He told of Fleury and Stackhouse and the Faraway
Woman&mdash;of McArliss, of striking the reef,
and day by day in the open boat.... Davy’s
eyes bulged. The boy saw Stackhouse at one end
and quiet manhood in the other. He sat with Bellair,
whom he could understand, in the point of
balance between these forces. Bellair told of the
stars and the child, and the distance from which
they viewed the little things of the world and the
grand simplicity of God. He pictured the man
Fleury had become&mdash;the straight-seeing, the fearless,
the ignited man, who mastered the lie in his
heart and the animal in his abdomen&mdash;the man he,
Bellair, wanted to be, and wanted Davy to be....
The <i>Formahaut</i> came, with Spika agleam to
the northward, and Fleury died&mdash;the picture in
his mind of a man, rising rather than falling....
Bellair told him of the first moment he heard the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>real voice of Fleury, as he stood on the tilted deck
of the <i>Jade</i> in the dark, while he went back for
water.... “I’ll hold a place for you!”</p>

<p>“A real man always says that, Davy. A real
man will hold a place for you. And I thought, as
I saw Stackhouse die and remembered his life,
that he was the saddest and most terrible animal
in human form. He was a glutton and a coward,
but mainly he broke his own heart and not others.
He was a slave to his stomach, but there was life,
not creeping death, in his mind. I saw the pictures
that moved there, low, vivid pictures, animal
dreams, but he was not a destroyer of children or
a breaker of the hearts of men. Low Nature was
loose in him, but it was not a predatory instinct
alone. Having enough, he could give. He could
give fifty thousand dollars and a wallet full of
valuable papers for a bottle of whiskey&mdash;but the
Lots and the Wetherbees would have died clutching
their money. I learned Stackhouse, Davy&mdash;only
to understand that there is a depth below his.
I think I should have taken you out somehow&mdash;if
they hadn’t let you go&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Davy asked questions, and the story came better
and better. The thing that held him especially
was the last days in the open boat.</p>

<p>“And did you really suffer less when you decided
to make it a fast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was true in my case. Many have set
out to fast ten days, and done with as little as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>did. Of course it was harrowing, because we
didn’t know when it would end; then the little
baby was there, and the mother.”</p>

<p>“And you think <i>he</i> was really as happy as he
said?”</p>

<p>“Davy, lad, Fleury was a prince. He would
have given you his shirt. He had himself going
so strong <i>for us</i>&mdash;that the fire of happiness ran
through him. I’ll give you some books about that.
It’s really a fact. You can’t suffer pain, when
you’ve got something really fine up your sleeve
for another. Perhaps you’ve felt it at Christmas&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re all out of yourself-like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said the man.</p>

<p>More words would have stuck in his throat.
Davy got it&mdash;got something of it. Bellair had
come to ask so little, that this seemed a great deal....
He followed Davy down and into the street.
It was still two hours before he was due at the
<i>Castle</i>.</p>

<p>“How long does it take to get to your house,
Davy?”</p>

<p>“About twenty-five minutes. It’s ’way down
town.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I should go home and meet your
mother. I have the time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, come with me. She will be watching.”</p>

<p>They passed a delicatessen-store, ripe cherries in
the window, and a counter full of provisions that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>would have been far more thrilling had they not
dined so well.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we might take home an armful
of these things?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>Davy dissuaded weakly.... That clerk must
have thought him mad, for Bellair merely pointed
to bottles and jars and baskets&mdash;until they were
both loaded. There was a kind of passion about
it for the man. He hated to stop; in fact did not,
until it occurred to him that this was not the last
night of the world, and that Davy doubtless required
many more substantial matters, which
would furnish a rapturous forenoon among the
stores&mdash;to-morrow forenoon....</p>

<p>They sat in an almost empty downtown subway
train, their bundles about them, the stops called
by the guard. They both hunched a little, when
the stop nearest Lot &amp; Company’s was called, but
did not speak. Farther and farther downtown&mdash;the
last passengers leaving. It was the hour the
crowds move upward. Strange deep moments for
Bellair&mdash;moments in which this was more than
Davy sitting beside him. This was Boy&mdash;Davy
Acton but the symbol of a great need.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">6</p>

<p class="no-indent">A hurried walk to the east with their bundles
to a quarter that Bellair had not known
before, past the great stretches of massive
buildings which the day had abandoned, to a low
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>and older sort that carried on a night-life of their
own, where children cried, halls were narrow, and
the warmth became heaviness.... A plump
little woman who had not lost hope (she did not
see the stranger at first because the boy filled
her eyes); a dark, second-floor hall, a little room
with a lamp and a red table-cloth; a door at either
end, and opposite the door they entered, one window....
How bewildered she was with the
bundles, desiring to prepare something for them
right away. Indeed, it would have helped her to
be active in their behalf.... Bellair was
smiling.</p>

<p>Davy told part and Bellair part. Presently all
was forgotten in the presence of the calamity that
had befallen. It was slow to change her mind
about Lot &amp; Company. Davy had impressed upon
her for two years the lessons administered there.
Not to be changed in a moment, this estimate&mdash;that
before all poverty, before all need, and above
all hope, a place at Lot &amp; Company’s was a permanent
place, “if a fellow did his part”&mdash;that
Lot &amp; Company was an honest house. Davy told
of the paper Mr. Bellair had forced from them,
and Bellair touched upon the life he had led in
those halls, just a little and with haste. To help
him to speak authoritatively, he added that he
would help Davy to another position.... Then
he looked around, and glanced at his watch. There
was a small anteroom which they occupied....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>Bellair had asked about the other door. “An
empty room,” Mrs. Acton told him.</p>

<p>Of course it was for rent. On the spur of the
moment, he declared he would take it, asked her
to rent it for him, insisting on paying in advance.
He would come in the morning&mdash;have his things
brought later.... No, Davy was not to look
for a position to-morrow. Davy must devote himself
to him to-morrow. He left them happily.
The mother called after him in hopeless excitement
that he had left enough to rent the room all
summer.</p>

<p>He did not show the Lot &amp; Company paper to
Bessie; in fact, he never showed it but once, and
that was to Davy Acton immediately after it was
obtained. He had thought of taking it across the
street to show the landlady, but perhaps that
would merely have added to her living confusion.
It had been most important for Davy, but to
reopen the subject with Bessie, his manner might
have touched an “I-told-you-so” indelicacy....
She was happy when he found her that night.
Clothes in quantity were already begun&mdash;the next
ten forenoons at the dressmakers’. She thanked
him charmingly, studied him with a quizzical expression
that invariably haunted him afterward.</p>

<p>Bellair could never tell just what would do it,
but occasionally through an hour’s chat, he would
say something, just enough above her comprehension
to challenge her. Once opened, her faculties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>were not slow, but the life she had chosen, held her
mind so consistently to its common level that the
habit was formed. Mainly when he spoke above
her, she ceased to listen, ignored him; but when
something he said just hit home, she praised him
with animation, as one would a sudden gleam of
unexpected intelligence on the part of a child.
It became one of his most remarkable realisations
that a man who has anything worth while
to say must come down to say it, just as certainly
as he must go up to get it.</p>

<p>The sense of adventure with her did not return
this night, though she had seemed to accept him
differently from before; as if he belonged, part of
her impediment mainly, but at moments of surpassing
value, like a machine that one packs a
day for a half-hour’s work it may do. His money
had purchased something.</p>

<p>Bellair sat in the dark of his room, feet on the
window-sill, hat still on, at two o’clock, his last
night in the hotel where he never had belonged.
He was very tired and longed for sleep; and yet
there was a different longing for sleep than that
which belonged to physical weariness. It had to
do with his hunger for the Faraway Woman. This
startled him. What was that refreshing mystery
afterward? Did he go to her in sleep&mdash;did she
come? Why was it that the burden of parting
invariably increased through the long days? It
had been so on the ship. In the morning he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>live; then the hours settled down, until it seemed
he must leap back to her; the ship’s ever increasing
distance at times literally twisting his faculties
until he was dazed with pain.</p>

<p>He had not thought of this before. Why was
it always when the pressure increased and the ardour
mounted&mdash;that he longed for sleep?...
Nothing came to his work-a-day brain from the
nights. His dreams were of lesser matters&mdash;and
yet, something within pulled him to unconsciousness
like the rush of a tide. It gave him a sense
of the vastness, a glimpse of the inner beauty of
life.</p>

<p>Far below in the side-street a heavy, slow-trotting
horse clattered by. The motors were more
and more hushed, even the hell of Broadway subdued.
A different set of sounds came home to him,
but he did not interpret for the present; their
activity playing upon deeps of their own&mdash;a
bridge swung open between them and his exterior
thoughts....</p>

<p>Slowly all exterior matters slipped away&mdash;the
mother and Davy and Bessie. The bridge between
the surface and the deeps swung to, and he
heard the sounds that had been thrilling his real
being all the time as he sat by the window&mdash;the
liner whistles that crossed Manhattan from the
harbour, the deep-sea bayings which seemed to be
calling him home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p class="center no-indent">7</p>

<p class="no-indent">Bellair must have rested well in a few hours,
for he arose early, feeling very fit in and
out. For years the man he had seen in the
glass when he was alone, had aroused little or no
curiosity; a sort of customary forbearance rather.
The fact is, he had not looked close for years.
This morning as he shaved, something new regarded
him from the face, still deeply dark from
the open boat. He called it a glint, but would
have designated it as something that had to do
with power in another. It was fixed&mdash;something
earned and delivered.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was something she had seen.</p>

<p>This animated him. It had come from Fleury
and the fasting, but most of all from contemplating
her face and her nature. Was it the arousing
of his own latent will? Was it because he was
lifted above Lot &amp; Company? What part of it
had come from the anguish of separation? Truly
a man must build something if he manages to
live against the quickened beat of a hungry
heart.</p>

<p>The face was very thin, too. He had felt that
so often as he used the morning knife, but he saw
it now. Thin and dark, and the boy gone altogether....
Bellair smiled. Lot &amp; Company had
tried to take the boy. Had they not failed, the
man would never have come, but something craven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>in the place of the boy, something tied to its own
death, its soul shielded from the light&mdash;a shield
of coin-metals.</p>

<p>He shuddered, less at the narrowness of his own
escape, than at New York whose business came up
to him now through the open windows.... The
shaving had dragged. He was not accustomed to
study his own face. The very novelty of it had
held him this time&mdash;and especially the thought of
what she might have seen there. Suddenly he
wanted something big to take back to her&mdash;a manhood
of mind and an integrity of soul&mdash;something
to match that superb freedom she had wrung from
the world. A thousand times the different parts
of her story had returned to his mind, always filling
him with awe and wonder. She had come like
one with a task, and set about it from a child,
against all odds, putting all laws of men beneath&mdash;as
if the task had been arranged before she
came. He knew that the essence of this freedom
was in the hearts of women everywhere, but she
had made it manifest, dared all suffering for it.
And yet with all the struggle behind her, the gentleness
which he had come to know in her nature
was one of the great revelations. It gave him a
vision of the potential beauty of humanity; it
made him understand that one must be powerful
before one can be gentle; that one must master
one’s self before one dare be free. All that he
had was far too little to bring home to her. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>morning he felt that nothing short of the impossible
was worth going after.</p>

<p>A little later as he was leaving the room, the
telephone rang. The operator said that a gentleman
wanted to see him. On the lower floor, Bellair
glanced into the eyes of a young man who
wanted something; “glanced <i>into</i>” is somewhat
inaccurate; rather his eyes glanced from the
other’s, and took away a peculiar, indescribable
interest. It was the look of a colt he had seen,
a glitter of wildness and irresponsibility in a face
that was handsome but not at its best.</p>

<p>Bellair had seen something of the expression in
the faces of young men who had been fathered too
much; those who had not met the masterful influence
of denial, and had been allowed to lean too
long. The face had everything to charm and to
express beauty and reality with, but the inner
lines of it were not formed; the judgments lacking,
the personal needs too imperious. He had
made the most of well-worn clothing, but appeared
to feel keenly the poorness of it.</p>

<p>“I came in here yesterday,” he said hastily. “It
all happened because the ledger was turned back.
I glanced at it, as one will, and standing out from
the page was ‘Auckland, N. Z.’ It was as if written
in different colour to me. I followed the line
back to the name&mdash;and tried to see you yesterday
afternoon and last night. You didn’t come
in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“You come from Auckland?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“It’s more than a year.... Small thing to
meet a stranger on, but it was all I had. Auckland
is so far and so different&mdash;that when I saw it&mdash;it
seemed there must be a chance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course. I know how it is,” said Bellair.
“Do you want to get back?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t it, exactly, though I haven’t anything
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Have you had breakfast?”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>“Come in with me and we’ll talk. I have a
half-hour to spare.”</p>

<p>Bellair heard his voice and wondered at the
coldness of it. He remembered afterward the
covered billiard-tables at the far end of the hall
and the dimness of the hall’s length, as he led
the way. His own custom was a pot of coffee
and a bit of toast, but the other’s possible need
of food had a singular authority over him, so
he made out that this was one of the main feeding
features of his day.... But the other was intent
upon certain things beside food. He had been unlucky.
Everything that he had tried in the year
of New York had failed him somehow&mdash;little ventures,
positions lost&mdash;and always some one was to
blame, not this one who spoke and had suffered so.
Bellair hearkened for one note that would confine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>itself to the unfinished mouth and the unstable
character; one note that would suggest the possibility
of a clue that the series of failures lay in
his own shortcomings of strength and quality, but
the boy had not this suggestion in his heart.</p>

<p>“Are you married?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s lull, and then was turned
off another story of misfortune:</p>

<p>“... I didn’t want to marry her. I got her in
trouble down in New Zealand. Her father wanted
me to marry her&mdash;was willing to pay for it&mdash;but
a fellow can’t take a chance like that. We came
up together with the kid to New York, but everything
broke bad for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The voice went on, but Bellair lost his face.
There was a greenish-yellow light between their
faces, at least, for Bellair’s eyes, and the floor
seemed shaken with heavy machinery. Bellair
knew the burn of hate, and the thirst to kill&mdash;and
then he was all uncentred, like a man badly
wounded. He arose.</p>

<p>“... The fact is, I don’t think she was quite
<i>right</i>. None of them are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I won’t be able to hear any more of that just
now,” Bellair said slowly. “I’m leaving this hotel
to-day for other quarters. But to-morrow morning
at ten, I shall be here and listen to what you want.
Perhaps I can set you straight a bit&mdash;for the present,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
anyway. And this&mdash;is so you won’t miss any
meals in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair handed him money.</p>

<p>“Please excuse me,” he added. “And finish
your breakfast&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He called the waiter and signed the card. Then
he turned as if to look around the room. He
located the door by which they had entered, drew
his hands strangely across his eyes. Effusive gratefulness
was seeking his ears from the young man
in the chair. Bellair lifted his hand as if to cut
off the voice, and then started for the door, his
step hastening.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">8</p>

<p class="no-indent">It was truly a tenement quarter in which Davy
and his mother lived. The fact awed Bellair
somewhat. Had he been a cripple in a wheeled-chair,
confined to one side of one block, he could
have found a life’s work.... Little faces that
choked him everywhere. One might toss coins at
their feet, but the futility of that was like a cry
to God.</p>

<p>Davy’s mother was making his room ready. By
some chance it faced the east; between ten and
noon, there was sunlight. Forty years ago it had
been the kitchen of a second-floor apartment,
doubtless respectable. Only the scars of the
kitchen fixtures remained, like organs gone back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>to a rudiment in swift involution. Water now
was to be had in but one place on each floor&mdash;in
the hall, and the natives came there with their
pitchers and cans as tropical villagers, morning
and evening to the well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Acton had spared a bit of carpet, which
looked as if it had been scrubbed; and just below
the window the tip of a heaven-tree waved. It
was thin as his single bed, but even that growth
seemed miraculously attained, as if the seed must
have held all the nourishment. Bellair stared
down through shadows and litter, and could discern
no more than a crack in the stone pavement,
from which this leafy creature had come to him.
Quite as miraculously it was, with the myriad children
in the streets and halls. Certainly this was
a place to keep tender. Davy had gone forth on
an errand.</p>

<p>“What was he interested in especially when he
was little?” Bellair asked.</p>

<p>“Boats&mdash;boats,” said the mother.</p>

<p>It struck the man queerly that he had not noted
this. Davy had devoured his little list of sea
stories, and had listened as no one else to the open
boat narrative, but the man fancied it just the
love of adventure. Bellair’s mother might have
said the same thing.</p>

<p>“Did he draw them, you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and played with them. His father was
a seaman, Mr. Bellair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>Bellair’s father had not been a seaman, but there
was little to that. They were one in the initial
proclivity. Perhaps if the truth were shaken
down, there was something in this fact that had
to do with their relation.</p>

<p>“Could I have breakfast and supper here with
you?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>The woman looked startled. “You see, I am
away three days a week.”</p>

<p>It was Bellair’s idea to make this impossible,
so he insisted:</p>

<p>“My wants are simple. I might not be here
always to supper&mdash;but, of course, I should want to
pay for it. It would be pleasant&mdash;we three together&mdash;and
no matter to me if supper were a bit
late. You see, Mrs. Acton, now that I’ve begun,
I insist on having a home. I lived in one room
for five years, and that sort of thing is ended. A
hotel is no better.”</p>

<p>Davy returned and Bellair took him forth at
once, impatient to continue the adventure of the
purchases, begun the night before. Hours passed.
Once Davy looked up to him in a mixture of awe
and joy:</p>

<p>“Why are you buying so many things for us,
Mr. Bellair?”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” the man answered.</p>

<p>They were in a retail clothier’s. The salesman
drew back.</p>

<p>“Davy,” said Bellair, “it’s the most natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>thing. First I have the money and you have the
needs. Second, we are friends&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair had felt many things hammering for
utterance, but when he had come thus far, he
found that the whole ground was covered....
The boy hurried home, but Bellair was not ready.
With all his affection for the lad, he wanted to be
alone. He had held himself to Davy’s needs for
hours; but through it all, the sentences&mdash;so brief
and thoughtless across the breakfast table&mdash;recurred
smitingly. They hurt everything in him
and in an incredible fashion. He marvelled that
he had been able to reply quietly. His face burned
now, and he thought of the Faraway Woman&mdash;how
gentle she had been, blaming nothing, holding
no sense of being wronged. It was that which
helped him now, though his heart was hot and
aching.... One must have compassion for the
world&mdash;one whose home is the house of such a
woman.</p>

<p>“It must not hurt the Gleam,” he said half-aloud.
This was the burden of all his effort.
“The Gleam is hers. I must not let the thought
of this touch the Gleam&mdash;not even in my
mind.”</p>

<p>The young man was stranded in New York.
They met as arranged the next morning.
Many difficulties were related, and the perversities
of outside influences and the actions of others.
The great regret was that at a certain time when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>he <i>had</i> the money more than a year ago, the young
man had delayed for a day to purchase a certain
little tobacconist’s shop on Seventh avenue. A
friend of his had advised him against it, and
plucked the fruit himself. This gave Bellair an
idea.</p>

<p>In the next ten days, everything seemed waiting
for the manager of the <i>Follies</i> to decide the case
of Bessie Brealt. Davy was permitted to look
for a new job, but Bellair made light of his unsuccess....
He did not look up Broadwell
again, understanding clearly that the advertising-man
would endanger his position in calling on
him. Bellair was not ready to be responsible for
such a loss to Broadwell. Employés of Lot &amp;
Company did not change easily.... He was
frequently, but never long with Bessie during
these days. There were moments of disturbing
sweetness, and moments that he struggled quickly
to forget, as Nature sets about hastily to cover
unseemly matters upon the ground.</p>

<p>Now that the great event of her life had come,
Bessie required much sleep, and cared for her
beauty as never before. She already lived, for the
most part, in the actual substance of victory, as
only the young dare to do; yet she lost none of her
zeal in preparation.... Bellair held to the original
idea, though the means was not yet articulate.
He was sensitive enough to realise that a man may
be impertinent, even when trying to help another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>The tremendous discovery in this interval was
that the open boat events which had proved so salutary
and constructive in his own case, did not appear
to have a comparable effect upon others when
he related them. He began to believe that he had
not authority, and that he must somehow try to
gain authority by making good with men. He had
his story to tell. He had seen the spirit and the
flesh&mdash;beast and saint&mdash;watched them die. All
life and hope and meaning were caught and held,
as he saw it, between the manner of the deaths of
two men. This experience had changed him&mdash;if
not for the better&mdash;then he was insane.</p>

<p>It was hard for him to grasp, that the thing
which had changed him could not change others&mdash;even
Bessie. Yet those who listened, except Davy
and his mother, appeared to think that he was
making much of an adventure for personal reasons.
He tried to write his story, but felt the bones
of his skull as never before. He began, “I am a
simple man,” but deep guile might be construed to
that.... “I want nothing,” he wrote, “but to
make you see the half that I saw in the open
boat,” and he heard the world replying in his consciousness,
“The open boat is on this man Bellair’s
nerves. It’s his mania. The sun or the
thirst <i>did</i> touch him a bit.”...</p>

<p>He became afraid to talk much even with Bessie,
and New York boomed by, leaving him out&mdash;out....
He tried to lift the signs of misery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>on the way to the home of Davy’s mother, and in
the surrounding halls, but the extent and terror of
it dismayed him; and remarkably enough, always
this same answer came: that he must get himself
and the South Sea business in hand before a true
beginning could be made here....</p>

<p>It wasn’t on Seventh avenue that he found a
cigar store to suit his purpose in this interval, but
the promise was certainly as good as the old one.
He put the New Zealand young man in charge, on
a basis designed to challenge any one’s quality;
and having done this in a businesslike fashion,
Bellair made haste to escape. The sense was cool
and abiding in his mind that in this case, as in
Lot &amp; Company’s, the circle was complete. Still
he retained the suspicion that the young man did
not believe him sane.</p>

<p>He followed the singer when she permitted, to
dressmakers, rehearsals, quartette performances
and meals; found other men following singers
similarly, in all their byways of routine; he disliked
them, disliked himself.</p>

<p>He had not told her of his fortune, because he
knew in his heart it would change everything. He
helped in many small ways, and allowed her to
believe what she chose. She had never identified
him with large things, did not think the present
arrangement could last, and made as much as possible
of the convenience. They were together on
the night before her try-out, though as usual it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>was but a matter of moments. Bellair used most
of them in silence. The tension of hurry always
stopped his throat. He longed for one full day
with her, a ramble without the clock; yet what
would he do with it&mdash;he, who dared not go to the
water-front alone&mdash;to whom the night whistling
of steamers in the harbour was like the call of the
child of his heart?</p>

<p>“You are at your best,” he said. “Your voice
was never sweeter than to-night. You must go
now and sleep. To-morrow, of course, you will
win, and when may I come?”</p>

<p>Her face clouded. Perhaps because he said the
opposite, the thought of possible defeat came now
with a clearness which had not before appealed to
her unpracticed imagination.</p>

<p>“You may come to my room at twelve&mdash;no, at
one. I shall go there at once after the trial&mdash;and
you shall be first.”</p>

<p>It pleased him, and since she did not seem inclined
to leave just then, Bellair found himself
talking of the future. Perhaps he did not entirely
cover his zeal to change a little her full-hearted
giving of self to the foam. Bessie bore it. He
had not spoken of the open boat, but something he
said was related to it in her mind.</p>

<p>“To-morrow will settle everything,” she declared....
“And I don’t like that other woman
on the ship. She isn’t human. You think it
amazing because she didn’t cry and scream. That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>isn’t everything.... She’d be lost and unheard
of here in New York.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is probably true.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right for people who don’t write or
paint or sing&mdash;to talk about real life and what’s
right work in the world, but artists see it differently.
Anyway, it’s the only job we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Bellair never forgot that, or rather what she
had meant to say.</p>

<p>“Singing is what drew me to you, Bessie. What
I object to is what the world tries to do with its
singers, and that so many singers fall for it.”</p>

<p>“The world lets you more or less alone&mdash;until
you make good. Plenty of time after that to
answer back.”</p>

<p>She yawned. It was as near reality as they had
gotten, and Bellair, who asked so little, had a
glimpse again of the loveliness he had first taken
to sea&mdash;even to the kiss at the last. She also
granted him this:</p>

<p>“You’ve been good to me. I couldn’t have
done without you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He lay awake long. The house in which he
lived was very silent, and it pressed so close to the
sea.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">9</p>

<p class="no-indent">She was only partly dressed when he came
early the next afternoon, but was not long in letting
him in. Before any words, he knew that she
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>had won. A man often has to readjust hastily
after the night before. It was so with Bellair
now. Her eyes were bright with emotions, but a
certain hardness was shining there. It was an
effort for her to think of him and be kind. He
would have seen it all in another’s story.</p>

<p>His glance kept turning to her bare arm, upon
which a hideous vaccination-scar was revealed.
<i>They</i> had not thought of her singing in those days....
She had never spoken of her house or her
people. It was enough that those days were finished.
Bellair could understand that. Her victory
was all through her now, satisfying, completing
her. She did not love money for its own
sake or she would have treated him differently.
All her surplus energy, even her passion, was
turned to this open passage of her career. Having
that, previous props could be kicked away; at
least, Bellair felt this.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all done. A month of solid rehearsal&mdash;then
the road. I take the second part, but I
hope to come back in the first&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were at your best at the trial?”</p>

<p>“After the first moment or two.... And no
more Brandt’s or <i>Castle</i>&mdash;no more with the other
three&mdash;God, how sick I am of them&mdash;and of this
room!”</p>

<p>“Will you lunch with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I have until three.”</p>

<p>It was shortly after one. She talked with animation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
about her work, her eyes held to a glistening
future. She finished her dressing leisurely,
with loving touches, abandoning herself completely
to the mirror as an old actress might, having
conceded the essential importance of attractions.
She studied her face and figure as if she
were the maid to them. Bessie dressed for the
world, not for herself, certainly not for Bellair.
Without, in the world&mdash;streets, restaurants, theatres&mdash;there
existed an abstraction which must be
satisfied. She had not yet entered upon that perilous
adventure of dressing for the eyes of one man.
She did not think of Bellair as she lifted her arms
to her hair. On no other morning could she have
been so far from the sense of him in her room.
Empires have fallen because a woman has lifted
her naked arms to her hair with a man in the room.</p>

<p>An older woman would have rewarded him for
being there; an older woman never would have
put on her hat for the street without remembering
her humanity. There was something in Bessie
that reserved the kiss for the last. Possibly after
the last song of the day, a kiss remained. She
put on the flowers he brought; even that did not
remind her, nor the dress he had bought for her&mdash;asking
him if he approved, not that she cared, but
because she was turning before the glass with the
thing upon her body and mind. She would have
asked a child the same.</p>

<p>They went to Beathe’s for luncheon, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>also Bessie’s breakfast. There, it may have been
that she was ready to forget herself, knowing it
would keep for a little. In any event, she seemed
to see Bellair as he ordered for her, as if recalling
that he had made many things move easily of
late, and that it was pleasant to have these matters,
even luncheons, conducted by another.
Thinking of him, the voyage was instantly associated:</p>

<p>“I said last night that I didn’t like that
woman,” she began. “I didn’t mean just that, of
course. But a woman can see another woman better
than a man. There are women who keep their
mouths shut and get great reputations for being
wise and all that. They never associate with
women. You’ll always find them with men, playing
sister and helping and saying little. Men get
to think they’re the whole thing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose there are,” said Bellair.</p>

<p>He wished she had not picked up this particular
point again; and yet a certain novelty about this
impressed him now, and recurred many times
afterward&mdash;that it was she who had broached
the subject.</p>

<p>“Do you think a man knows men better than a
woman does?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bessie had not thought of it; she was not sure.</p>

<p>Nor was Bellair. “The fact is, it doesn’t
greatly matter what women think of women, and
what men think of men&mdash;compared to what men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>and women think of each other,” he observed.</p>

<p>“You say you didn’t know that other man at
first&mdash;that preacher,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s true. There had to be danger&mdash;I had
to hear his voice in danger.”</p>

<p>Bellair was lifted to his life-theme. He had
never really told it in one piece. He did not mean
to now, but Fleury came clearly to mind. The
food was served and it was quiet behind the palms.
If he could only say something for her heart.
She seemed ready. Points of human interest were
crowding to mind&mdash;perhaps he could hold her
with them.</p>

<p>“... His every thought was for others,” he
was saying. “I disliked him at first, but he was so
kind and good-natured throughout that he could
not fail to impress me a bit, but I didn’t really see
him before the night of the wreck, when he arose to
take things in hand. It was not noise, nor voice,
but a different force. He seemed to rise&mdash;so that
the huge Stackhouse was just a squealing pig before
him. He had no fear. You looked into his
face and wanted to be near him, and to do what
he said. I caught his secret. A fool would. It
was because he wasn’t thinking of himself. It
seems, Bessie, as sure as you live&mdash;that the more
a man gives out in that pure way Fleury did for
us all&mdash;the more power floods into him. It came
to him in volumes. We all knew it&mdash;even Stackhouse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“And this is what I’m getting at. <i>You’ve</i> got
the chance to use it. I can’t yet. I seem to be
all clotted with what I want, but you can! You
did. You pulled me out of the crowd, not knowing
me at all&mdash;made me come to you&mdash;changed
me. You can <i>give</i> with your singing&mdash;to hundreds&mdash;so
that they will answer in their thoughts,
and do things strange to themselves at first.
They’ll want to die for you&mdash;but that isn’t the
thing for you. You must want to sing for them&mdash;want
to give them your soul all the time. Greater
things will come to you than this&mdash;this which
makes you happy. All that the world could give
you&mdash;you will come to see&mdash;doesn’t matter&mdash;but
what you can give the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He saw her falling away from his story. It
crippled him. He did not think he could fail so
utterly.</p>

<p>“But you <i>were</i> a thief,” she said.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;was what?”</p>

<p>“You preach all the time, but you were a
thief&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had heard aright. His hand reached for
the wallet, that contained the letter from Lot &amp;
Company, but fell from it again.</p>

<p>“If you like,” he answered, “but I saw a beast
die in the open boat&mdash;and saw a saint die&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You preach&mdash;preach&mdash;preach!” she cried, and
her own points of view returned with greater intensity.
“You’ve been kind&mdash;but, oh, you bore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>me so! You have been kind&mdash;but oh, don’t think
you fail to make one pay the price! You were
sunstruck, or crazed&mdash;and you come back preaching.
I’m sick of you&mdash;just in my highest day,
after the months of struggle&mdash;I hate you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair heard a ship’s bell. It was dark about
him&mdash;a cool, serene dark. The air fanned him
softly and sweet; the place rocked&mdash;just for an
instant, as if he were at sea.</p>

<p>“I hate you when you preach,” she finished.
Her voice was softer. He knew she was smiling,
but did not look at her face. She had delivered
him. He was calm, and ineffably free, the circle
finished.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh, that we two were Maying</i>&mdash;&mdash;” he muttered,
his thoughts far down the seas&mdash;remote and
insular, serene and homing thoughts.</p>

<p>“It takes two to sing that,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But, I’m so sick of that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must have sung it many times,” he said.</p>

<p>He did not want to linger. A certain hush had
come to her from him. It was not yet three....
He seemed surprised to find it broad day in the
street. She touched his sleeve, drawing him to the
curb, away from the crowds which astonished him.
Clearly something was wrong with his head.</p>

<p>“Bessie&mdash;before your salary begins&mdash;have you
everything? Isn’t there something&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>She smiled and hesitated. He rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>“I’m so glad I thought of it,” he said, drawing
forth the brown wallet.</p>

<p>His gift bewildered her, but she did not ask
him this time what he wanted. Instead she asked:</p>

<p>“But where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Why, Bessie, I’m going home.”</p>

THE STONE HOUSE: II</h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">1</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> hard thing was to get Honolulu behind.
The first seven days at sea was
like a voyage to another planet. Bellair
could lose himself in the universe,
between the banging of the Chinese gongs that
called passengers willingly, for the most part, to
meals on the British ship <i>Suwarrow</i>.... They
had crawled out of the harbour in the dusk, a
southwest wind waiting at the gate, like an eager
lover for a maiden to steal forth. She was in his
arms shamelessly, before the dusk closed, the voices
from the land hardly yet having died away. Bellair
watched their meeting in the offing. The
blusterer came head on; the <i>Suwarrow</i> veered coquettishly
and started to run, knowing him the
swifter and the stronger, as all woman-things love
to know. Presently he had her, and they made a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>night of it&mdash;the moon breaking out aghast from
time to time, above black and flying garments of
cloud. Bellair enjoyed the game, the funnels
smoking the upper decks straight forward. They
were making a passage that night, in the southward
lift of that lover.</p>

<p>He had found a little leaf of cigars in a German
shop in Honolulu; the same reminding him of
Stackhouse. They were <i>Brills</i>, with a Trichinopoli
flavour, a wrapping from the States, the main
filler doubtless from the Island plantations. The
German had talked of them long, playing with
the clotty little fellows in his hands, for they were
moist enough, not easily to be broken. “You sink
your teeth in one of these after a good dinner,”
he said, “and if you do not enjoy tobacco, it is
because you have been smoking other plants.
These are made by a workman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bellair smoked to the workman; also he smoked
to Stackhouse. Something kindly had come over
him for the Animal. Lot &amp; Company had helped
him to it.... Yes, he thought, the animal part
is right enough. It is only when the human adult
consciousness turns predatory that the earth is laid
waste and the stars are fogged.... These were
but back-flips of Bellair’s mind. In the main he
was held so furiously ahead, that body and brain
ached with the strain. As nearly as he could describe
from the sensation, there was a carbon-stick
upstanding between his diaphragm and his throat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>Every time he thought of Auckland, it turned
hot.</p>

<p>... He knew better where to begin now. The
beginning was not in New York. The wallet was
heavy upon him; he must not waste it; nor allow
it to waste itself through bad management. Auckland
was a desirable centre for the Stackhouse
operations. He could travel forth from one
agency to another. The fundamental ideas of
trade, together with large knowledge of how trade
should not be conducted, was his heritage from
Lot &amp; Company. He would begin slowly and
sincerely to work out his big problems&mdash;holding
the fruits loosely in his hands; ready to give them
up to another, if that other should appear; contenting
himself only with the simplest things;
preparing always to be poorer, instead of richer....
He would earn the right to be poor. The
thought warmed him, something of the natural
strength of youth about it.</p>

<p>Standing out of the wind with an expensive
cigar, a superb course-dinner finished less than an
hour back, Bellair smiled at the ease of poverty,
welcoming all the details of clean, austere denial.
Yet he was not so far from it as would appear.
He had always taken these matters of luxury and
satiety with tentative grasp; even the dinners of
Stackhouse were but studies of life. His ideal was
closely adjusted to the Faraway Woman’s in these
things. One of the dearest of her sayings had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>do with renting the two front rooms of the stone
cottage. Yet now he hoped furiously that she
had not yet done so.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned again out among the
Islands. He would meet the agents of Stackhouse.
They would be bewildered at first; they
would think he had come to peer and bite. He
would lift and help and pass on&mdash;making the circles
again and again, gaining confidence, not saying
much. No, the thing he had in mind had little
to do with words.... What a masonry among
men&mdash;here and there one giving his best secretly.</p>

<p><i>No words about it.</i> Bellair halted and filled
his lungs from the good breeze. This thought had
repeated itself like a certain bright pattern through
all the weave of his conception. It had a familiar
look, and a prod that startled him now. The
whole meaning of it rushed home, so that he
laughed.</p>

<p>He had reached in his own way, the exact point
that Fleury had set out with. He was determined
to act. He had ceased to talk.... Just then
looking up from his laughing reverie, he saw a star.
It was ahead, not high, very brilliant and golden.
It had only escaped a moment between the flying
black figures of the night, but more brilliant for
that. It was vast and familiar&mdash;the meaning tried
the throat and struck at his heart with strange
suffering.... Yes, the <i>Suwarrow</i> was lifting the
southern stars. There could be no doubt. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>looked at that mighty sun too often from the open
boat to mistake. Fleury had said if it were as near
to earth as our sun, this little planet would be
dried to a cinder in ten seconds. It was the great
golden ball, <i>Canopus</i>.... A hand was placed
softly in his. Bellair was startled. He had been
far away, yet the gladness was instant, as he
turned down to the face of Davy Acton.</p>

<p>“She’s better,” the boy said. “I’ve been trying
to get her to come up on deck. She told me to ask
you, if you thought it best.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Davy&mdash;I’ll go with you to get her.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">2</p>

<p class="no-indent">He had seen very little of Mrs. Acton during
the voyage. Sailing was not her feat, but
the lady was winsome after her fast. Bellair had
found her very brave, and there had not been such
an opportunity to tell her so, as this night. He
wanted enough light to see her face, and enough
air to keep her above any qualm. They found a
cane-table, on the lee-side, toward America, the
light of a cabin passage upon it. Bellair ordered
an innocuous drink for Davy and himself, and
whispered along a pint of champagne, having
heard it spoken well of as an antidote for those
emerging from the sickness of the sea.</p>

<p>“... It’s a little charged, cidery sort of a
drink&mdash;just made for people convalescent from the
first days out of ’Frisco,” he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>
<p>She drank with serene confidence, and leaned
back to regard the glass and the two.</p>

<p>“It’s not unlike a wine I drank long ago,” she
observed, and her eyes warmed with the memory.</p>

<p>“A wine?” he said.</p>

<p>“Just so, but it’s no crutch for the poor, I should
say, by the way it comes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She pointed to the service-tub, which, unfortunately,
was of silver.</p>

<p>“They like to keep it cold,” Bellair suggested.</p>

<p>“It would need ice to keep that cold,” she replied.</p>

<p>There was a lyrical lilt to her words that he
had not known before; in fact he hadn’t quite
known Mrs. Acton before. She was lifted from
the stratum of the submerged. She had her hands,
her health, and the days now and ahead were novel
in aspect. A little seasickness was nothing to one
who had met the City, and for years prevented it
from taking her boy. The heart for adventure
was not dead within her.... In fact, Bellair,
surveying the little plump white creature in new
black, with a sparkle in her eye, her hand upon the
thin stem of a glass, entered upon a pleasant passage.</p>

<p>“You see, Mrs. Acton&mdash;I’ve been struck ever
since we sailed by the courage you showed in crossing
the world like this, at the word from a
stranger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stranger,” she repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>“I wanted you to take me up on that, but the
fact is, you came at my word.”</p>

<p>“’Twas not much I had to leave&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I liked it better than the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Bellair, I never gave up
the hope of travel&mdash;a bit of travel before I passed?
But I thought it would be alone from Davy&mdash;&mdash;”
Her eyes glistened.</p>

<p>Bellair was wondering if there were others in
that tenement-house who had kept a hope.</p>

<p>“You know,” he said, “when I decided to ask
you to come&mdash;because I was far from finished with
our lad&mdash;I anticipated that it would be somewhat
of a struggle. I saw how hard it was for you at
first&mdash;the night we told you about his loss of a
place&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We were on the edge so long&mdash;the least bump
ready to push us over,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“I made a little arrangement with the express
company to furnish you with a return ticket&mdash;you
and Davy, or cheques to secure them, and
enough beside to get you back to New York at
any time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her eyes widened. She turned to her boy to
see if he were in this great business. Wonders had
not ceased for him, since the first evening at the
hotel. Davy was intent upon her now, even more
than upon his friend.</p>

<p>“So I had it all fixed in your name. There’s an
agency in Auckland&mdash;one in every city&mdash;so you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>can’t go broke. And no one can cash these things
but you&mdash;after you call and register your signature.
You’ll find enough and to spare for your
passage (though I hope you won’t use it for many
a year), and expenses for you and the boy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes. Bellair poured
her wineglass full in the excitement.</p>

<p>“You didn’t need to do anything like that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s a point I am particularly proud of,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“I’ll put this away for you,” she said, taking
the proffered envelope.</p>

<p>The face of dusty wax-work sped past his inner
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s all one,” she added. “It’s easy for me to
say this, having nothing but what you give me.
Did you hear of the house where every one put
what they had in a basket hanging from the ceiling?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said.</p>

<p>“’Twas mainly empty. The poor are great-hearted,
and those who have nothing.... This,
I’ll put in no basket, but the bank, and you’ll have
it when you get through giving away the rest. I’ll
trust in the Lord, sure, to take me home&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been very successful in giving away
much,” he said. “That’s our problem down here
among the Islands. Davy is to grow up and help
me. You are to help us. There is another to help
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Acton finished her glass. “Is it as much
as that, then?”</p>

<p>Davy was regarding her with fine pride in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Bellair sent him to the cabin for a book that
would be hard to find, and turned to the boy’s
mother:</p>

<p>“I’ve got something to say to you about Davy.
I brought back a story and a fortune from my
other trip down here. The story was more important
by a whole lot. It changed everything
for me. I thought I’d only have to tell it, to
change others. That didn’t work. But Davy
listened, and he wasn’t the same afterward.</p>

<p>“I didn’t understand him at first. I used to
think when he didn’t speak, he was bored. I used
to think I had to entertain him, buy him with gifts.
But I was wrong. He was thinking things out for
himself all the time. He was puzzled at first why
any one cared to be good to him and be a friend to
him&mdash;God, what a price the world must pay for
making boys as strange to kindness as that....
But this is what I want to say. He believed in
me long ago in Lot &amp; Company’s. I succeeded in
making him believe in me again. And because he
believed in me, he believed in my story, and when
he heard that&mdash;he wasn’t the same afterward.</p>

<p>“I tell you, boys are full of wonderful things,
but the world has shut the door on them. All
we’ve got to do is to be patient and kind and keep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>the door open, and we’ll have human heroes about
us presently, instead of wolves and foxes and parrots
and apes.... I learned that from Davy
Acton. After he accepted me, he got my story&mdash;and
that showed me that my work is with boys,
and that first I’ve got to make them believe in me.
I’ve got to be the kind of a man to win that.
We’ll all pull together&mdash;you and Davy and that
other and I.</p>

<p>“I’m going to help Davy, and I’m going to help
boys. They’re not set. They change. They are
open to dreams and ready for action. They can
forget themselves long enough to listen. The
world has treated them badly; the world has been
a stupid fool in bringing up its children. Why,
it’s half luck if we manage to amount to anything!
I think I know now how to do better. I’m going
to try. Why, I’d spend five years and all I have
to give one boy his big, deep chance of being as
human as God intended. I’ll help boys to find
their work, show them how to be clean and fit and
strong. I’ll show them that <i>getting</i> is but an incident,
and when carried too far becomes the crime
and the hell of the world.... He’s coming
back&mdash;and he’s found the book, too. I must use
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He had told his story in a kind of gust, and the
little woman had listened like a sensitive-plate, her
eyes brimming, her son moving higher and higher
in a future that was safe and green and pure....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>It had come out at last for Bellair. He was
happy, for he knew that this which had been born
to-night, with the help of the mother’s listening,
was the right good thing&mdash;the thing that had
come home from hard experience to the heart of a
simple man.</p>

<p>“Davy,” he said, “I’ve got a suspicion that your
mother could eat something. Call a steward, lad.”</p>

<p>She started and fumbled for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Do you know&mdash;that is&mdash;I might try a bite,
Mr. Bellair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man was smiling. Davy returned and sat
down wonderingly between them. His mother
kept her mouth covered, but her eyes were wells
of joy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it’s that cider that needs
keeping so cold,” she began steadily, “or this
which Mr. Bellair has been saying, but the truth
is, Davy, I haven’t been so happy since a girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A little lunch will fix that,” Bellair suggested
absently.</p>

<p>“If it will,” she returned, “tell the man that it’s
nothing I wish for, this night.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">3</p>

<p class="no-indent">Auckland passengers were not to be landed
until the morning, but the <i>Suwarrow</i> sent one
boat ashore that night. By some law unknown
to the outsider, a few top bags of mail
were discriminately favoured, and they were in
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>the boat. The second officer, with a handful of
telegrams to be filed; a travelling salesman called
home from the States on account of family illness,
also Bellair were in the boat. He had told Davy
and his mother that he was going to prepare a
place for them; that he would be back on the deck
of the <i>Suwarrow</i> before nine in the morning. Because
the little landing party was out of routine,
an hour or more was required for Bellair to obtain
release to the streets. It was now midnight.</p>

<p>Three months away, and there had been no
word from the woman who had remained. In
fact, no arrangement for writing had been agreed
upon, except in case New York should hold him.
He had never seen the writing of the Faraway
Woman.... He believed with profound conviction
that within an hour’s ride by trolley from the
place in the street where he moved so hastily now,
there was a bluff, a stone cottage, a woman waiting
for him, and a child near her; that all was well
with the two and the place. Yet he lived and
moved now in a wearing, driving terror. All his
large and little moments of the past three months
passed before him like dancers on a flash-lit stage,
some beautiful, some false and ugly, but each calling
his eyes, something of his own upon them.</p>

<p>The world had shown him well that man is
not ready for joy when he fears, yet Bellair was
afraid. Man deserves that which he complains of.
Still, he was afraid. He was exultant, too.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>Cities might change and nations and laws,
but not that woman’s heart. He did not believe
she could love him, but he knew of her fondness
hoped for that again. She was in a
safe place&mdash;as any place in the world is safe. She
was well, with a health he had never known in
another, and the child was flesh of her. Yet he
feared, his heart too full to speak. He did not deserve
her, but he hoped for the miracle, hoped that
the driving laws of the human heart might be merciful,
hoped for her fondness again.</p>

<p>He would stand before her at his worst&mdash;all
weakness and commonness of the man, Bellair,
open before her. Perhaps she would see his love
because of that, but he would not be able to tell
her. Never could he ask for her. If it were made
known, it would not be through words. It could
only come from him in a kind of delirium. <i>He</i>
must be carried away, a passion must take him out
of self. Very far he seemed from passion; rather
this was like a child in his heart, with gifts, deep
and changeless, but inarticulate, as a child is. It
had been long in coming, quietly fulfilling itself,
and this was the rising.</p>

<p>... The last car was gone, but he found a carriage&mdash;an
open carriage, a slow horse, a cool and
starry night. The city was growing silent, the
edges darkened. There were high trees, a homing
touch about them after the sea, and a glimpse of
the harbour to the left. Bellair had not even a bag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>with him. He would take off his hat for a way,
and then put it on again. Sometimes he would
let his ungloved hand hang overside, as one would
do in a small boat. There was a leathery smell
from the seat of the carriage, with a bit of stable
flavour, that would get into a man’s clothes if he
stayed long enough. It was dusty, too, something
like a tight room full of old leather-bound books.</p>

<p>The horse plumped along, a little lurch forward
at every fourth beat. Hunched and wrapped, the
driver sat, and extraordinarily still&mdash;a man used
to sitting, who gave himself utterly to it, a most
spineless and sunken manner. Every little while
he coughed, and every little while he spat....
Once they passed a motor-car&mdash;two men and a
girl laughing between them; then the interurban
trolley going back&mdash;the car he had missed. His
heart thumped. It was the same car that he had
known, the same tracks, no upheaval of the earth
here so far.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bellair was rounding the Horn in
the <i>Jade</i>; they struck rock or derelict, were lost
for ages in an open boat; they came to Auckland
and found a little stone house on the bluff, paused
there....</p>

<p>He was away at sea again, from Auckland to
’Frisco, across the States, to <i>Brandt’s</i>, to <i>Pastern’s</i>,
to Lot &amp; Company’s and the tenements, to the
<i>Castle</i> and the Landlady’s House; then trains and
the long southern sweep of the <i>Suwarrow</i>, down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>the great sea again to this ... plumping along
on the high, rocky shore. The brine came up to
him, almost as from the open boat. His eyes
smarted, his throat was dry, and the driver
coughed.</p>

<p>Bellair had paper money in his hand. He
meant to look at it under the carriage-light, when
he stepped forth near the Gate. He leaned forward
and touched the great coat.</p>

<p>“<i>Whoa</i>,” said the man, loud enough to rouse
the seven sleepers, and the horse came up with a
teeter.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop,” said Bellair. “It’s a little ahead
yet. I’ll tell you when to stop.... Yes, let him
walk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Now, Bellair surveyed what he had said. He
was like that, just about as coherent as that. The
<i>whoa</i> had shaken him empty for the most part....
He would not know what to say to her. He
would sit or stand like a fool and grin.... But
she was great-hearted. She would help him....
Awe and silence crept into him again.</p>

<p>“Now, pull up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Whoa</i>,” was the answer, shaking the trees.</p>

<p>“There, that will do,” Bellair said tensely. He
stepped out and passed over the money, forgetting
to look at it. He was afraid the man would roar
again.</p>

<p>It was nearer than he thought, but a step to the
Gate; its latch lifted softly and he crossed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>gravel, held by the voice of the rig turning behind.
It turned slowly as a ship in a small berth, and
the voice carried like the cackle of geese....
There was no light. He was on the step. Something
sweet was growing at the door.... Something
brushed him at his feet. He leaned down
in the darkness, and touched the tabby-puss,
knocked softly.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;” came from within.</p>

<p>“It is I, Bellair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The door was opened to absolute blackness. She
was not in his arms. Rather he was in her arms.
She seemed to tower above him. Around was the
softness and fragrance of her arms and her breast....
Not the cottage&mdash;her arms made the home of
man. She held him from her, left him standing
bewildered in the centre of the room. He heard
her match, and her voice like a sigh, trailing to
him almost like a spirit-thing:</p>

<p>“Oh,&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;so&mdash;happy!”</p>

<p>The lamp was lit, but she left it in the alcove,
came to him again, a shawl about her. Lights
were playing upon his shut eye-lids, fulfilment in
his arms that a man can only know when he has
crossed the world to a woman, not a maiden; a
plenitude that a maiden cannot give.</p>

<p>And now she brought the light, and looked into
his face&mdash;her own gleaming behind it, full of rapture,
the face of a love-woman, some inspired
training of the centuries upon it, all the mystery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>and delicacy for a man’s eyes that he can endure
and live....</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>He could only look at her.</p>

<p>“What is it?” more softly.</p>

<p>As if the thing had been left over in his mind,
and required clearing away, he answered:</p>

<p>“Are&mdash;are the rooms rented?”</p>

<p>She laughed, came closer than the light.</p>

<p>“We are alone&mdash;only the child. I could not
let any one come&mdash;the rooms seemed yours....
I thought you would come. It was time enough to
change when I heard from you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The little Gleam&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is here.... Oh, did you know what it
meant to us&mdash;when you went away?”</p>

<p>“I knew what it meant to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“After the open boat and the days together
here&mdash;you knew all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be easier.... And you
are changed! You are like a man who has found
his Quest.”</p>

<p>She was about him like magic. They were moving
toward the little room. She stopped and put
the lamp back in the alcove.</p>

<p>“We will not take it in there. It would wake
him.”</p>

<p>... It was dark upon the threshold. She took
his hand. He heard her heart beating, or was it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>his own?... They heard the little breathing.
She guided his hand to the warm little hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is well,” she whispered. “Everything
is perfect with your coming.... There....
You hurried home to me, didn’t you?... Yes,
I hoped. I felt the ship. I could not sleep. I
wondered if I could be wrong.... Oh, to think
of the dawn coming in&mdash;finding us here together
... and the little Gleam....”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gray light was coming in. Her face was shadowed,
but the gray was faint about her hair. His
heart had taken something perfect from her; something
of the nature of that peace which had come
to him at the <i>Jade’s</i> rail crossing the Line, but
greater than that, the fulfilment of that. Because
it was perfect, it could not last in its fulness.
That was the coolness of the Hills, but his love
was glowing now like noon sunlight in a valley,
the redolence of high sunlight in the river lowlands.
Mother Earth had taken them again.</p>

<p>It was the tide of life; it was as she had told
him it must be with her, akin to the loveliest processes
of nature, like the gilding of a tea-rose, like
the flight of swans. He watched her as the dawn
rose, as a woman is only to be seen in her own
room; watched her without words, until from the
concentration, that which had been bound floated
free within him.... A sentence she had spoken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>(it may have been an hour, or a moment ago)
returned to his consciousness. “Oh, how I wanted
you to come home to-night!”</p>

<p>His mind was full of pictures and power. It
may have been the strangeness of the light, but
his eyes could not hold her face, nor his mind remember
the face that had welcomed him in the
lamplight. Different faces moved before his eyes,
a deep likeness in the plan of them, as pearls
would be sorted and matched for one string, a
wonderful sisterhood of faces, tenderness, fortitude,
ardour, joy, renunciation. It was like a
stroke. He had loved them all&mdash;facets of one
jewel. And was the jewel her soul?</p>

<p>He arose, without turning from her, and moved
to the far corner of the room, where there was
neither chair nor table. As he moved, he watched
her with tireless thirsting eyes.</p>

<p>She arose and came to him, moving low....
This figure that came, thrilled him again with the
old magic of the river-banks. He could not pass
the wonder of her crossing the room to follow him....
And now he saw her lips in the light&mdash;a
girl’s shyness about her lips. She was a girl that
instant&mdash;as if a veil had dropped behind her. It
had never been so before&mdash;a woman always, wise
and finished with years, compared to whom that
other was a child. And yet she was little older
than that other&mdash;in years. He loved the shyness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>of her lips. It was like one familiar bloom in
the midst of exotic wonders. It seemed he would
fall&mdash;before she touched him.</p>

<p>She was low in his arms, as if her knees were
bent, as if she would make herself less for her
lord.... And something in that, even as he held
her, opened the long low roads of the past&mdash;glimpses
from that surging mystery behind us all&mdash;as
if they had sinned and expiated and aspired
together.</p>

<p>“... That you would come to me&mdash;&mdash;” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“I have wanted to come to you so long.”</p>

<p>“I thought&mdash;I could not tell you&mdash;I thought I
would stand helpless without words before you.
Why, everything I thought was wrong. I can
tell you&mdash;but there is no need&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is little need of words between us.”</p>

<p>... That which she wore upon her feet was
heel-less, and all the cries and calls and warnings
and distances of the world were gone from between
them, as they stood together.... And
once her arms left him and were upheld, as if to
receive a perfect gift. A woman could command
heaven with that gesture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They had reached the end of the forest, and
found the dawn. The sounds of the world came
back to them like an enchanter’s drone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>
<p>“Come,” she said, taking his hand, “it is day.
We must return to the village. And oh, to our
little Gleam! He is awakening. He will speak
your name.”</p>

<p class="ph2 nobreak">BY WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT</p></div>

<div class="adblock">
<p class="center no-indent"><i>A Brief Expression of the Critical Reception of</i></p>

<p class="ph2">DOWN AMONG MEN</p>

<p><i>Outlook</i>: Possessed of a marvelous descriptive
genius, equipped with a remarkably flexible
use of English and impelled by the passion of a
mystic&mdash;the author of <i>Down Among Men</i> has
written a striking novel.</p>

<p><i>The Dial</i>: Seems to us the most exalted and
appealing story Mr. Comfort has thus far written.</p>

<p><i>The Argonaut</i>: A novel of extraordinary
power. It is good as <i>Routledge Rides Alone</i>. It
could hardly be better.</p>

<p><i>London Post</i>: Alive with incident, bounding
with physical energy, dramatic in coloring, and
modern in every phrase. He has a message delivered
with vigor, inspired with tense passion.</p>

<p><i>Atlantic Monthly</i>: There is so much real fire
in it&mdash;the fire of youth that has seen and suffered&mdash;so
much vitality and passion that one grows
chary of petty comments. The writer offers us
the cup of life, and there is blood in the cup.</p>

<p><i>Chicago Record-Herald</i>: An almost perfect
tale of courage and adventure.</p>

<p><i>Chicago Tribune</i>: Contains some of the most
remarkable scenes that have appeared in recent
American fiction.</p>

<p><i>New York Times</i>: Few richer novels than
this of Mr. Comfort’s have been published in
many a long day.</p>

<p><i>New York Globe</i>: We can say in all sincerity
that we know of no recent bit of descriptive writing
that can match this for sustained, breathless,
dramatic interest.</p>

<p><i>Springfield Republican</i>: <i>Down Among Men</i>
is perhaps the most ambitious American novel that
has come out during the past year.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="adblock"><div class="chapter">
<p class="ph2">MIDSTREAM</p></div>

<p>... A hint from the first-year’s recognition of
a book that was made to remain in American literature:</p>

<p><i>Boston Transcript</i>: If it be extravagance, let
it be so, to say that Comfort’s account of his childhood
has seldom been rivaled in literature. It
amounts to revelation. Really the only parallels
that will suggest themselves in our letters are the
great ones that occur in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>....
This man Comfort’s gamut is long and he has
raced its full length. One wonders whether the
interest, the skill, the general worth of it, the
things it has to report of all life, as well as the
one life, do not entitle <i>Midstream</i> to the very
long life that is enjoyed only by the very best of
books.</p>

<p><i>San Francisco Argonaut</i>: Read the book. It
is autobiography in its perfection. It shows more
of the realities of the human being, more of god
and devil in conflict, than any book of its kind.</p>

<p><i>Springfield Republican</i>: It is difficult to think
of any other young American who has so courageously
reversed the process of writing for the
“market” and so flatly insisted upon being taken,
if at all, on his own terms of life and art. And
now comes his frank and amazing revelation, <i>Midstream</i>,
in which he captures and carries the reader
on to a story of regeneration. He has come
far; the question is, how much farther will he go?</p>

<p>Mary Fanton Roberts in <i>The Craftsman</i>:
Beside the stature of this book, the ordinary novel
and biography are curiously dwarfed. You read
it with a poignant interest and close it with wonder,
reverence and gratitude. There is something
strangely touching about words so candid, and a
draught of philosophy that has been pressed from
such wild and bitter-sweet fruit. The message
it contains is one to sink deep, penetrating and
enriching whatever receptive soul it touches. This
man’s words are incandescent. Many of us feel
that he is breathing into a language, grown trite
from hackneyed usage, the inspiration of a quickened
life.</p>

<p>Ida Gilbert Myers in <i>Washington Star</i>: Courage
backs this revelation. The gift of self-searching
animates it. Honesty sustains it. And Mr.
Comfort’s rare power to seize and deliver his
vision inspires it. It is a tremendous thing&mdash;the
greatest thing that this writer has yet done.</p>

<p>George Soule in <i>The Little Review</i>: Here is
a man’s life laid absolutely bare. A direct, big
thing, so simple that almost no one has done it
before&mdash;this Mr. Comfort has dared. People who
are made uncomfortable by intimate grasp of
anything, to whom reserve is more important than
truth&mdash;these will not read <i>Midstream</i> through,
but others will emerge from the book with
a sense of the absolute nobility of Mr. Comfort’s
frankness.</p>

<p>Edwin Markham in <i>Hearst’s Magazine</i>: Will
Levington Comfort, a novelist of distinction, has
given us a book alive with human interest, with
passionate sincerity, and with all the power of his
despotism over words. He has been a wandering
foot&mdash;familiar with many strands; he has known
shame and sorrow and striving; he has won to
serene heights. He tells it all without vaunt, relating
his experience to the large meanings of
life for all men, to the mystic currents behind
life, out of which we come, to whose great deep
we return.</p>

<div class="adblock"><div class="chapter">
<p class="ph2 nobreak">RED FLEECE</p></div>

<p><i>Springfield Republican</i>: The first genuine war
novel.</p>

<p><i>Outlook</i>: The first novel of any real consequence
dealing with the great war.</p>

<p><i>San Francisco Argonaut</i>: An extraordinary
book. The reader of Comfort’s book is carried
away on a storm of emotion.</p>

<p><i>New York Tribune</i>: Decidedly the first notable
novel of the great war is Will Levington
Comfort’s <i>Red Fleece</i>. Comfort sees in the
moujik’s dreamy soul the seed of a spiritual regeneration
of the world.</p>

<p><i>The Dial</i>: As a stylist, Mr. Comfort has never
done better work. “His clothing smelled of
death; and one morning before the smoke fell, he
watched the sun shining upon the smoke-clad
hills. That moment the thought held him
that the pine-trees were immortal, and men just
the dung of the earth.” It is not given to many
men to write such English as that.</p>

<p><i>Boston Transcript</i>: This is a story written in
wireless. It leaves a lightning impression.</p>

<p><i>New York Times</i>: This novel has one most
unusual fault. It is not long enough.</p>

<p><i>Churchman</i>, New York: By far the most interesting
and thoughtful book of fiction springing
from the great war.</p>
